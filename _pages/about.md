Rick&#8217;s journey in Information Technology started in 1997, where he began his career providing hardware support at a Value Added Reseller of AST Computers. By mid 1998 he joined a regional internet service provider where he began supporting UNIX based systems that were critical to the companies dial-up, DSL and web-hosting services. This was the same year that he was introduced to VMware and their technology. In 2001, Rick took his knowledge and experience to The City of San Diego where over his 9 year tenure he formed and lead a Technical Architecture team, brought VMware Virtualization to life and led the march for a next generation data center and end-user computing.

    In 2008 Rick took his experience to the Internet by starting his blog site, VMwareTips.com. Shortly after starting his blog site he started contributing to the San Diego area VMware Users Group (VMUG) where he helped lead the group bringing virtualization knowledge to the community. Also during this time-frame he started contributing as a technical editor for a number of published books on VMware, including Scott Lowe&#8217;s &#8220;Mastering VMware vSphere 4&#8221;. In late 2009 Rick was honored by becoming one of the first VMware Certified Design Experts (VCDX), #21 to be exact. The VCDX is VMware&#8217;s highest level certification, which requires two exams, one lab focused exam and a final design and defense process which is conducted by other VMware VCDX&#8217;s.

In this role he evangelizes the benefits of virtualization, application modernization and next generation end-user computing. His deep technical experience and business knowledge allow him to carry conversations at all organizational levels, including executive management. His ability to turn business requirements and technical possibilities into successful projects makes him one of the most sought after resources within the organization.
