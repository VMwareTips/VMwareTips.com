Planning is in full swing for what will be the 12th Annual VMworld Conference, which will be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and the Fira Gran Via in Barcelona, Spain.

This is by far one of the largest tech industry conferences with typically over 20k attendees and pretty much every vendor under the sun in attendance. It basically means that you don&#8217;t want to be left out, so make sure you <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/conference/us/plan/pricing" target="_blank">pre-register</a> to get an amazingly low price.

What this also means is that <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/voting.jspa" target="_blank">session voting</a> is now open, and I need your help! I&#8217;m planning on running three awesome Ask the Experts sessions this year, and the names on these panels are sure to cause some excitement.  But, the only way we can be guaranteed a spot on the agenda is if we get the votes and support from the community.

So, what do these sessions look like?

**4593 &#8211; Ask the Expert vBloggers
  
** Duncan Epping (VMware), Scott Lowe (VMware), Chad Sakac (EMC) and Chris Wahl.

**4594 &#8211; Ask the Expert VCDXs
  
** Joe Clarke (AdvizeX), Matt Cowger (EMC), Jason Nash (Varrow) and Chris Wahl.

**4595 &#8211; Ask the Expert Industry Titans
  
** Kit Colbert (VMware), Chad Sakac (EMC), Vaughn Stewart (Pure) and Nicholas Weaver (Intel).

I&#8217;m super excited to see all three of these sessions come to life, historically we&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with the Ask the Experts series and I want to continue the tradition in 2015.

So please, vote early and vote often! :)   <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/voting.jspa" target="_blank">Click here to vote</a>!
