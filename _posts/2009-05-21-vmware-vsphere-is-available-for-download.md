I know I&#8217;m a little late in the game today to announce this, but I was busy with meetings and whatnot. But, the day we&#8217;ve all been waiting for has come (some of us have been waiting almost two years!), VMware vSphere 4 has been officially released to the public.  The <a href="http://www.vmware.com/download" target="_blank">VMware Download Site</a> now includes links to Download, Evaluate and Buy VMware vSphere 4.

Some of the things I noticed were that the licensing page is different, you can now quickly and easily view your vSphere 4 licenses keys;

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Support Contract Management is also a lot easier, if you are the Primary License Administrator (PLA) you can assign Secondary License Administrators and also Support Administrators;

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  One final thing I wanted to touch on was the fact that the VMware Download Site now has a built-in Download Manager that you can use, which in my opinion, is extremely helpful as some of these vSphere files can be close to 2GB.
</p>

  Well, that&#8217;s it for now.  Need to get back to upgrading vCenter !  If you haven&#8217;t already, I strongly suggest you go <a href="http://www.vmware.com/download" target="_blank">download vSphere</a> for yourself and try it.
