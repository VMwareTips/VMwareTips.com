VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID:	VMSA-2017-0007
Severity:	Critical
Synopsis:	VMware vCenter Server updates resolve a remote code execution vulnerability via BlazeDS
Issue date:	2017-04-13

1. Summary
VMware vCenter Server updates resolve a remote code execution vulnerability via BlazeDS
2. Relevant Products
VMware vCenter Server
3. Problem Description
Remote code execution vulnerability via BlazeDS

VMware vCenter Server contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to the use of BlazeDS to process AMF3 messages. This issue may be exploited to execute arbitrary code when deserializing an untrusted Java object.

Note: The issue is present in the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) opt-in UI. If a customer has opted out of CEIP, the vulnerability is still present. Also, opting out will not remove the vulnerability.

The table below lists the versions of vCenter Server that have a fix for the issue. It also lists the VMware Knowledge Base articles that document a workaround that removes the vulnerability.

VMware would like to thank Markus Wulftange of Code White GmbH for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2017-5641 to this issue.  

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.
