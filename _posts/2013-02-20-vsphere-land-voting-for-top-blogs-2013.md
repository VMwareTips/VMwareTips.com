[<img class="alignleft" style="margin: 3px 10px;" title="Rock The Vote! 2013" src="https://www.vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/vote-rock-the-vote-poster-227x300.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="300" />](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1165270/Top-vBlog-2013)As most of my vFriends would know, I’m a huge fan of blogging and social media in general. I think it’s a great mechanism to reach out to the masses for the means to educate, and to push out messaging in a wide scale. I can honestly say that if it wasn’t for blogging and social media, I probably wouldn’t be where I am today professionally (thanks <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Chad</a>).

With that said, my good buddy Eric Siebert over at vSphere-land has opened up voting for his top blogs lists called the <a href="http://vlp.vsphere-land.com/" target="_blank">vLaunchPad</a>, and I’d like to reach out to my readers and frequent visitors to please go out to his site and <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1165270/Top-vBlog-2013" target="_blank">vote for me</a> along with your other favorite virtualization focused blogs. When you go vote you’ll be asked to choose your top-10 favorite blogs and boy is it going to be difficult to choose, the _blogosphere_ has blown up in 2012 and there are new blogs popping up almost daily so it may take you some time to choose.

Regardless of who you vote for, even if it isn’t me, please be sure to vote… as I can attest, blogging is almost like having another job as it is extremely difficult to find content to write on as well as develop. The people that are behind the great sites you’ll be voting on really put some great effort (typically at the expense of their families) to provide us with great information. Voting closes on 3/1, so please <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1165270/Top-vBlog-2013" target="_blank">Rock The Vote</a> as soon as possible! :)

Results will be presented on a special <a href="http://www.vmwarevideos.com/category/vchat" target="_blank">vChat Episode</a> featuring Simon Seagrave, David Davis, John Troyer and of course, Eric Siebert.
