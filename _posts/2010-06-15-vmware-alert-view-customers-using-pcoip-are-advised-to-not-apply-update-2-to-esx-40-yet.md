Everyone in the virtualization blogosphere has already covered this but I figured I should let my loyal readers know&#8230;

> Earlier today VMware became aware of an issue affecting users of VMware View after applying Update 2 to their ESX 4.0 hosts. The problem only effects PCoIP, RDP works normally. There is a discussion of the problem in the VMware Communities <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/thread/272320" target="_blank">here</a>.
> 
> While our IT Teams work to resolve the issue, the Knowledge Base Team has responded by creating an up-to-the-minute live document at: <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1022830" target="_blank">http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1022830</a> and using <a href="http://twitter.com/vmwarecares" target="_blank">@vmwarecares</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/vmwarekb" target="_blank">@vmwarekb</a> Twitter accounts to alert customers.
