So this is it!Â  Final presentations for VMworld need to be in by August 10th, so this is your last chance to submit an opening question for TA2259 &#8211; Ask the Experts (<a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/" target="_new">Duncan Epping</a>, <a href="http://www.planetvm.net" target="_new">Tom Howarth</a>, <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org" target="_new">Scott Lowe</a>, <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_new">Chad Sakac</a>) at VMworld 2009!

**One question that came up was if we were still going to have an open floor portion, and the answer is YES! The majority of the session will be open floor, but we do want to have a handful of good questions to help spin off the session and also for those _quiet_ moments.**

Question Submission is Now Closed! Thank you to everyone who submitted their questions.**
