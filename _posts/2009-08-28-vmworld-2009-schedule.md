I just wanted to share with you my schedule for next week, in the event you might be interested in meeting up with me and possibly getting your hands on some **_FREE_** VMwareTips.com swag! _(see right)_.  I&#8217;ve got VMwareTips.com buttons, stickers and polo shirts (Special Thanks to <a href="http://www.vkernel.com/CapacityAnalyzerDownload/?SRC=VMTIPSCA" target="_blank">VKernel</a>).

For the open times in my schedule, I&#8217;ll most likely be browsing the VMworld Solutions Exchange, probably at the <a href="http://communities.netapp.com/community/events/vmworld" target="_blank">NetApp</a> (Booth 2102) and <a href="http://www.vkernel.com/CapacityAnalyzerDownload/?SRC=VMTIPSCA" target="_blank">VKernel</a> (Booth 1832) booths. So be sure to come find me and show your support for VMwareTips but wearing a button or sticking a VMnut sticker on your laptop!
