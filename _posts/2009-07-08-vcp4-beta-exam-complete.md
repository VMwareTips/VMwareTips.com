Three hours and 270 questions later, the VMware VCP4 Beta Exam is complete.  Let me just tell you,  I was not prepared at all for this exam &#8211; no studying or even using vSphere at all today.  I&#8217;ve been so busy that the only thing I reviewed was the Configuration Maximums in my car for about 5 minutes before the test.

Because of the NDA I cannot get into great detail about the exam.  The process is extremely standard for Pearson VUE tests; sign in &#8211; verify ID &#8211; sign electronic signature &#8211; take picture. Then get escorted to an awesome home built PC with your VCP411 test ready to begin!

Out of the 270 questions, it felt that about 35% of them were fit of a VCP4 exam &#8211; the rest seemed a little more advanced, perhaps a Master or VCDX level even. But, perhaps they&#8217;re working on making the VCP a little more difficult?  I will say that you will need to know _some_of the Configuration Maximums, but not a lot. It would definitely benefit you to know about Paravirtualization, NPIV, iSCSI, Fault Tolerance, Host Profiles and dvSwitches.

With that said, I feel that I did pretty good, left a lot of comments &#8211; knew I wouldn&#8217;t have enough time to comment on every question, so I did skip some (thanks to VCDX Design Exam Beta for that experience). Hopefully I will find out my results in the 6-8 weeks advertised on the invitation, and not the 3-4 months I&#8217;ve been waiting since taking the VCDX Design Exam.
