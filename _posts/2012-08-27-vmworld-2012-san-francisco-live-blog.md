Hello and Welcome to VMworld 2012 in San Francisco! I&#8217;m going to try something a little different these next few days. I&#8217;ve created this aggregated page that will serve as a central repository for some live updates (mainly around keynotes, and sessions) as well as a live feed from my Twitter profile as well as my Instagram profile (for pictures). For my up to the minute VMworld 2012 Schedule please visit <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2012/08/03/vmworld-2012-itinerary/" target="_blank">this post</a>.

As you may have (or not) seen on Twitter, I&#8217;m participating in the #vHunt this year and I have some great things (books, stickers, etc) to give away! Just find me at #VMworld, take a picture with me and post it to Twitter with the #vHunt hashtag and you&#8217;ll be entered to win some other great prizes (think iPad, etc).

This is going to be an amazing week! I can&#8217;t wait for the fun to start (in about 7 hours!) and ingest all of the great information that we&#8217;ll be delivered. I also hope to see all of you at INF-VSP1504, our Ask the Expert vBloggers session which is on MONDAY at 2:30pm! 

So that&#8217;s it for now&#8230; let&#8217;s switch on the live blogging and hope this all works out! Have a Great Week!
