I was just invited by Cisco to be part of the BETA for the next release of the Nexus 1000V.  I&#8217;ll provide more details about the BETA after I install and test it out, but here are some teasers;

  * Virtual Service Domains: Supporting Layer 4-7 services such as VMware vShield
  * Security features for virtual desktop: IP Source Guard, Dynamic ARP Inspection, DHCP Snooping
  * VSM VMotion on its own VEM
  * Automated VSM Installer:  Configures VSM, vCenter Server Extension, System Port Groups
  * L3 Connectivity Between VSM and VEM: More flexible deployment
  * XML API
And guess what&#8230;?!   You can be part of the BETA too! Check out <a href="https://www.myciscocommunity.com/docs/DOC-9459" target="_blank">this link</a> and sign up to be part of the distributed virtual switch revolution!
