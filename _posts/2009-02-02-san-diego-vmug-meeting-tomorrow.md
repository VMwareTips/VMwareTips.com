Just wanted to post that the San Diego VMUG is tomorrow morning, if your in the San Diego area I suggest you stop by and check it out.Â  More information can be found on the San Diego <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmug/us-west/san_diego" target="_blank">VMUG website</a>, including a link for registration and directions. There typically isn&#8217;t that much activity from the VMUG in this area, so I hope this is the start of something new for the San Diego VMUG.
