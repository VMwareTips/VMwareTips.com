The VMware Labs team released a little gem of something that I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for quite some time. Taking the full install of the vSphere Client and creating a ThinApp package out of it&#8230;that&#8217;s right, the entire application in one small and easy to use executable file. The details on the <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/" target="_blank">flings</a> page says it best&#8230;

> Run vSphere client 4.1 in a snap. No install, just download the EXE and double-click. Place the ThinApped vSphere client on any network share and it will automatically stream to any Windows PC with no installation, agents, drivers, or specialized servers required. Carry ThinApped vSphere client and your customization on USB stick and now your vSphere client is available on the GO!

Download it for yourself from <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/thinapp-vsphere" target="_blank">here</a> today!
