As many of you know I&#8217;m currently on my honeymoon and I certainly shouldn&#8217;t be blogging, but this is too important to pass up! VMworld 2012 Session Voting is now open and I could use all of your help in getting my sessions approved for VMworld US and EMEA. That&#8217;s right people, I&#8217;ve submitted my sessions for both conferences and this would be the first time I&#8217;ve made it to VMworld Europe. So please, <a title="VMworld Session Voting" href="http://www.vmworld.com/www.vmworld.com/cfp.jspa" target="_blank">vote early and vote often</a> :)

  * ****1504 – Ask the Expert vBloggers &#8211; Scott Lowe, Duncan Epping, Rick Scherer, Frank Denneman, Chad Sakac**
  
** One of the highest rated sessions at VMworld is back for it’s fifth year! Come meet four VMware Certified Design Experts (VCDX) on stage answering your questions. We get the top Virtualization Bloggers in the industry and get them on stage answering your questions in a wide array of topics.
  * **1506** – **Designing a  Geo-Clustered VMware View (VDI) Environment** – Rick Scherer, Tyler Baker
  
**** Does your organization have multiple sites with a traveling workforce that may work in different locations? How does this put a damper on your VDI design and deployment? Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to design a solution that can offer follow-me computing regardless of the location your employee is in?
  
    In this session you&#8217;ll learn from a real life customer deployment on how to design a VDI environment that offers multi-site replication as well as load balancing which allows the employee to connect to the desktop in the datacenter closest to them which ensures the highest levels of performance and availability.
  * **1507** – Accelerate Your Journey to Your Cloud with Application Modernization** – Rick Scherer
  
****** Truth be told, IT as a Service (ITaaS) is not the end of the Journey to Your Cloud. Although IT Automation and Orchestration is critical to a successful ITaaS deployment, you need to modernize your applications to make your business truly cloud ready.
  
    Application mobility is going to be a critical piece to creating business agility, simply virtualizing your existing J2EE stack isn&#8217;t going to take you all the way, you must modernize your applications for mobility as well as in consideration for the influx of the massive amounts of Big Data our organizations can leverage.
  * **2715** – How to Ensure a Successful Cloud Implementation** – **Rick Scherer, Craig Chapman
  
**** There are a multitude of sessions that are addressing the technical needs of ensuring a successful cloud implementation. In this session the goal is to provide IT professionals strategies and methodologies to engage and service the business. By engaging the business IT professionals can gain an ally outside of IT in the implementation. With allies outside IT we gain valuable insight into the success of a cloud implementation.
  * **2790** – Ensuring Governance, Mitigating Risk while Maintaining Compliance in a Cloud Infrastructure &#8211; Rick Scherer
  
**** In this session you&#8217;ll learn how companies are deploying Cloud First models to Hybrid Cloud infrastructures while setting a solid GRC foundation.
  
    Learn the steps require to deploy your applications securely to the Cloud, protect your data, virtualize more assets and reduce the amount of infrastructure needed by leveraging vSphere-aware security products.

Thanks for taking the time to vote, but please don&#8217;t stop once you&#8217;ve voted for my sessions. There are a number of other excellent sessions from people like Duncan Epping, Frank Denneman, Chad Sakac, Scott Lowe, Chris Colotti, Kendrick Coleman, Jeremiah Dooley, a number of them from the EMC vSpecialists as well as a few joint sessions between Chad Sakac (EMC) and Vaughn Stewart (NetApp) which shouldn&#8217;t be missed!

Thanks again and I hope to see you at VMworld US and Europe!  As a gift, here is a picture from the beautiful Na Pali Coast on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.
