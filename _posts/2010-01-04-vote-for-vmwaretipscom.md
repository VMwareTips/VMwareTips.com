Wow, I cannot believe it is already 2010. I believe this year is going to bring some great things. For me it will bring a new home and the beginning of a new chapter in my life, I can&#8217;t wait!

I also feel it&#8217;s going to be the year of VDI and that virtualization is really going to hit the world even harder than it has already. I&#8217;m excited to see what&#8217;s in store for I.T. this year, and I&#8217;ll be even more excited to blog about it.

With that said, Eric Siebert at <a href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/time-to-vote-for-your-favorite-bloggers.html" target="_blank">vSphere-Land.com</a>is looking to update his Top Bloggers list. I&#8217;ve held positions #11 on the list for quite some time, and I&#8217;d love to maintain (or even go up on the list).  So please, go vote for VMwareTIps.com on his website, <a href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/time-to-vote-for-your-favorite-bloggers.html" target="_blank">click here to vote</a>.
