<a style="float: right;" href="/tp/.a/6a00d8341c328153ef01543330c84d970c-pi"><br /> </a> Using bulk import, customers can bring unmanaged machines under management of vRealize Automation. However, if transient issues occur while performing the import operation, this may result in destruction of the machine being imported and data loss.

To guard against such data loss, customers are urged to read KB article: <a href="http://vmw.re/1Pq0LM0" target="_blank">VMware vRealize Automation 7.0 patch to prevent potential data loss when using bulk import (2144526)</a>

Any updates to this information will be made in the KB article itself.
