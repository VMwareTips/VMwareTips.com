I&#8217;m truly honored to be part of such a great team and organization. On February 1, 2010 I joined EMC as a vSpecialist working within <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_blank">Chad Sakac&#8217;s</a> organization and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Our team is made up of some awesome rockstars, people like <a href="blog.scottlowe.org" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a> and <a href="http://nickapedia.com/" target="_blank">Nick Weaver</a>, we battle in the trenches on a daily basis spreading our love and evangelizing to the masses about VMware+EMC as well as VMware+Cisco+EMC. We work hard and we play harder.

Our team has grown significantly over the past year andwe&#8217;re continuing with that trend and are looking for talented people that have the passion&#8230;.people that love virtualization and people that love to talk about it. Here are some details taken from Chad&#8217;s blog;

> vSpecialists are EMC employees who’s fundamental job is to make sure that EMC wins overwhelmingly on our own merits whenever Virtualization is the context.   We do this for both VMware/EMC (bring your own server), and also support VMware/Cisco/EMC (the VCE go-to-market).
> 
> The team is now 150+ strong already, and with a full year under our belt, there’s structure.   There’s a structured onboarding process.  There’s structure roles and coverage models.   Those craving a total lack of structure (in every sense of the expression – both good stuff and bad stuff), but a similar personality profile – check out the VCE roles below.
> 
> This team’s credo is that we say “yes” to every challenge.   It is a LOT of fun, and leading that squad is the best gig I’ve ever had in my life. (**mine too Chad**)
> 
> The technical vSpecialists are expected to know everything (which is impossible) and so need to be perpetually be learning.  Technical folks have their VCP4 at least, VCAP-DCD and VCAP-DCA are bonus.   VCDX is a huge upside.   EMC Proven is a huge upside.  Cisco certs are a huge upside.  (**As Chad states, VMware experience/knowledge is a must &#8211; EMC+Cisco is a HUGE plus but take a 2nd/3rd ranking**) The right positive can-do attitude (throw me in front of any technical challenge and I can figure it out) is **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">mandatory</span>**.   **_Diversity is VERY desirable – while we have a mix of backgrounds, we share a love of tech.  I’m disappointed that more women haven’t applied._**

With all of that said, there are four active positions I&#8217;m personally trying to fill. Two in the Pacific Northwest, one in Los Angeles, CA and one in Houston, TX.  There are a number of other positions open, these are the four that I&#8217;m focusing on so if you are interested and are up to the challenge, PLEASE get hold of me!

**UPDATE &#8212;** There are also openings in Chicago, Minneapolis, the Carolinas and Florida&#8230;.in addition to my openings in the Pacific Northwest, Los Angeles and Houston. Please contact me if you are interested!
