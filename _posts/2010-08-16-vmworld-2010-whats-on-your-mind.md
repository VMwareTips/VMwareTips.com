With VMworld 2010 right around the corner we&#8217;d love to hear what&#8217;s on your mind in regards to virtualization and your environment. We in the vSpecialist organization at EMC would love to hear from you, this survey will be completely anonymous and will possibly help shape the future of virtualization.

  * What’s your IT infrastructure look like?
  * What do you like about it?
  * What frustrates you about it?
  * What do you think we should be doing that we’re not (EMC, VMware, or heck, the whole IT industry)?
  * What are YOU doing that’s cool?
