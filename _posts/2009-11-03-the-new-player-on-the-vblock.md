VMware, EMC, Cisco, VCE, Intel, Acadia&#8230;.whew! what does it all mean?! 

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1066" title="vblock" src="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/vblock.png" alt="" width="319" height="240" srcset="http://www.vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/vblock.png 319w, http://www.vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/vblock-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" />VMware, Cisco and EMC created a new marketing ploy called VCE (Virtual Compute Environment), this will provide technical innovations as well as integrated pre-sales services and support.

What is the product? vBlock.  Think of vBlock as the plug and play data-center solution, it will consist of Cisco UCS/Nexus/MDS, EMC Storage and VMware Virtualization all within a pre-designed and built rack solution &#8211; simply drop it in your data-center, plug it in and deploy virtual machines.  This is not really any different than purchasing HP Servers, NetApp Storage and VMware licenses separately. Ultimately it is the same solution, but now with a single SKU that partners will be able to sell.

I can&#8217;t say that VCE is really innovative, but it is brilliant from a business standpoint.  It will allow partners to sell a single source solution quickly and easily &#8211; no longer will VARs need to bring in multiple vendors to sell the entire design.

OK, so where does Intel come into this? Well with some venture capital from Cisco, EMC and Intel a new organization called Acadia is being formed.  Acadia will bring the vCloud into the private data-center.  In a phone conversation today, <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_blank">Chad Sakac</a> informed me that Acadia will provide a pay by usage solution for Enterprise users that aren&#8217;t ready for the public cloud. The solution will be completely supported and provided by Acadia and the customer will only be billed for what they use.  Pretty much a vBlock will be dropped into the customers data-center, the end-user will have a self-provisioning utility to create virtual machines and then they&#8217;ll receive a bill for actual utilization.  So no capital expense at all, your data-center now turns into a full 100% operating expense.

I didn&#8217;t plan on writing a full explanation on who/how/why. <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_blank">Chad Sakac</a> covers all of these topics extremely well on his blog and I invite you to check out the following links;
