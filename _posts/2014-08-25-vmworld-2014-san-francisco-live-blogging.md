Here we are, VMworld 2014. No Limits is the theme, and already new products (VMware EVO), <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2014/08/25/do-you-vrealize-whats-in-a-vname/" target="_blank">new names</a> (vRealize, vCloud Air) and ton&#8217;s of other awesome things have been announced. And we&#8217;re not even into the first General Session yet! As I sit in anticipation for Gelsinger to get on stage, this page will serve as the home to all things VMworld 2014.

This aggregated page will serve as a central repository for some live updates (mainly around keynotes, and sessions) as well as a live feed from my Twitter profile as well as my Instagram profile (for pictures). For my up to the minute VMworld 2014 Schedule please visit <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2014/08/18/vmworld-2014-itinerary/" target="_blank">this post</a>.

This is going to be an amazing week! I can’t wait for the fun to start and ingest all of the great information that will be delivered. I also hope to see all of you throughout the week and especially at my Ask the Experts session and my EMC Enterprise Hybrid Cloud session.

So that’s it for now… let’s switch on the live blogging, Have a Great Week!
