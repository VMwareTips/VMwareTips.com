In our effort to provide our viewers with up to the minute information on VMware related news and topics, we&#8217;re posting the following Special Alert direct from VMware Support Insider.

VMware has become aware of an issue with the vSphere Web Client 5.0 failing to load with the error:

<pre>RSL Error # of 29
 Error 2046</pre>

**Note**: The RSL Error (# out of 29) number may fail at different values.
  
**Note**: This issue only impacts only the usability of the vSphere Web Client 5.0

  * This error occurs regardless of the browser or version used.
  * This is independent of the Adobe Flash version installed.
  * Setting the system clock on an effected system back may allow the vSphere Web Client to work outside of the vCenter Server for a short amount of time.

For further diagnostic and mitigation information refer to KB article: <a href="http://vmw.re/1J5sejU" target="_blank">The vSphere Web Client 5.0 fails to load and displays the error: Error # of 29 2046 with RSL (2116567)</a>. Any updates to this information will be made in the KB article itself.
