In a clever marketing video NetApp produced (in house), NTAP takes on DD and e2 in an _8 Mile_ style rap battle. This was quite entertaining, thanks for the 4 minute break from a stressful day NetApp!

Special thanks to <a href="http://blogs.netapp.com/drdedupe/2009/02/2001-called-and-they-want-their-storage-back.html" target="_blank">Dr. Dedup</a> for posting the link to this video, I would&#8217;ve never seen it otherwise!



**Dedupe Rap Video Lyrics**

**E²**

_Been in the game since you was wearing pampers_ 

_You couldn’t crack my reputation with a sledgehammer_

_Every back-up is verified_ 

_Max-capacity 600 terabytes_

_My portfolio is so thick_

_Your gonna need a booster chair to sit on top of it_

_NTAP take a seat_

_You’re now rockin’ with the beast from the east_

**Double D**

_It&#8217;s Double D&#8217;s turn to hit the track,_

_You&#8217;re still using tape&#8230; what&#8217;s up with that?_

_That&#8217;s so 1990._

_Need a real back up you can call me_

_You see the scoreboard check it_

_I process over 2 gigs a second_

_There’s a new kid on the block_

_Double D &#8211; I’m gunning for the top spot_

**N-Tap**

_Put your hands up for N-E-T if you wanna De-Dupe say A-P-P_

_Put your hands up for N-E-T if you wanna De-Dupe say A-P-P_

_It’s obvious you got stage fright_

_Couldn’t save a txt file with Giga-byte_

_Your whole process is sloppy_

_We save Zeta-bytes he save floppy’s_

_Lack reliability when you copy_

_This guy bought himself into the technology_

_We perfected it_

_Customer solutions so effortless_

_De-Dupe – Backup &#8211; Recovery_

_Mass capacity – with Real scalability_

_You still living in the 70’s_

_No direct tape FC connectivity_

_Self-tuning the remedy_

_Your VTL software are you kidding me?_

_Limited – outdated_

_Need space? Ntap will duplicate it_

_Proliferate data call me_

_It’s so easy to use I could probably_ 

_Teach you and your crew_

_You-you and you_

_How to use it_ 

_Before we get to the end of the music_

**Music cuts off and he finishes…**

_Feel free_

_Pick a side, them or me_

_I’m superior to E2 and Double D_

_Go ahead doubt me_

_I don’t care, my technology_

_Crunch data anywhere_
