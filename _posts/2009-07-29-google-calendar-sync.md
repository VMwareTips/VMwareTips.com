Well, Google released a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=98563" target="_blank">Calendar Sync tool</a> that syncs your Outlook calendar to Google Calendar. I decided to start using this because my homepage is iGoogle, thus I can see my calendar from home right on my homepage without having to log-in. 

Now lets take it a step further, I installed Google Sync on my Home PC and now I have all my calendar entries from Exchange sync&#8217;d to Google Calendar and then sync&#8217;d to my Home PC &#8211; editable from any device (with 2-way sync enabled).
