Scott Lowe&#8217;s forthcoming book, _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_, is now available for pre-order via Amazon! Click <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Scott-Lowe/dp/0470481382/ref=sr_1_5/186-0823328-9552165?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242003333&sr=1-5" target="_blank">here</a> to see all the details. The book is available with a fairly significant discount (37%), but I donâ€™t know how long that price will last. Get it now!

More information on my involvement with _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_ can be found [here](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/03/05/working-on-a-book-with-scott-lowe/).
