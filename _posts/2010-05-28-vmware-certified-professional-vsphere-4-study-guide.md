The McGraw-Hill published VMware Certified Professional vSphere 4 (VCP410) Study Guide is now available for pre-order on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/VMware-Certified-Professional-vSphere-Certification/dp/0071633685/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275061917&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>! I had the honor of working on this book as the technical editor and I could tell you that if you&#8217;re planning on taking the VCP410 exam to become a VCP that this is the book to study with! The book will start to ship on June 15th and we will probably have it at VMworld as well.

Happy Reading!
