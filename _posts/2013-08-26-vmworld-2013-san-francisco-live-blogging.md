All Systems Go. VMworld 2013 has kicked off and things are in full swing. We&#8217;re about 10 minutes away from the Monday morning General Session beginning and there is definitely an excitement in the air. We have bloggers, analysts, customers, partners, attendees that have been to all 10 VMworlds (including myself) all standing around, mingling and anxious to hear Pat Gelsinger give his state of the union address.

This aggregated page will serve as a central repository for some live updates (mainly around keynotes, and sessions) as well as a live feed from my Twitter profile as well as my Instagram profile (for pictures). For my up to the minute VMworld 2013 Schedule please visit <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2013/08/25/vmworld-2013-itinerary/" target="_blank">this post</a>.

This is going to be an amazing week! I can’t wait for the fun to start and ingest all of the great information that will be delivered. I also hope to see all of you throughout the week and especially at my Ask the Experts sessions (VSVC4569 and VSVC4570)

So that’s it for now… let’s switch on the live blogging and hope this all works out! Have a Great Week!
