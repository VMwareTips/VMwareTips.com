As part of VMwareâ€™s ongoing testing and certification efforts on <a href="http://bit.ly/1qcldk7" target="_blank">Virtual SAN compatible hardware</a>, VMware has decided to remove some controllers from the Virtual SAN compatibility list. While fully functional, these controllers offer IO throughput that is too low to sustain the performance requirements of most VMware environments.

For more information, see KB article: <a href="http://bit.ly/Vz9xAg" target="_blank">Storage Controllers previously supported for Virtual SAN that are no longer supported (2081431)</a>. If you have purchased Virtual SAN for use with these controllers, contact <a href="http://bit.ly/1qclfbN" target="_blank">VMware Customer Service</a> for next steps.
