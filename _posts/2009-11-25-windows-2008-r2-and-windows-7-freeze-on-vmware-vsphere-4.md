Although this issue has been resolved with vSphere 4 U1, for those of you that haven&#8217;t upgraded please be aware of a known issue with Windows 2008 R2 and Windows 7 where the guest operating system can freeze for a long period of time.Â  The issue is noted in <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1011709" target="_blank">VMware KB 1011709.</a>

The resolution is to either upgrade to U1 or to use the standard SVGA driver and not the one provided in the VMware Tools package.

> **VMware KB 1011709 Excerpt&#8230;**
> 
> To deselect the SVGA drivers installed with VMware Tools:
> 
> When you install VMware Tools, select VMware Tools Custom Install and deselect the SVGA driver.
> 
> Alternatively, remove the SVGA driver from the Device Manager after installing VMware Tools.
