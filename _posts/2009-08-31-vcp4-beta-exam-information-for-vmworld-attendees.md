Today I received an e-mail making it official, along with a selection of great goodies!

The list of goodies included a VCP4 Hat, VMware Certified Professional button and some really sweet (sarcastic) light up glasses&#8230;which will probably come in handy on Wednesday night!

Well, thought I&#8217;d share that with you guys. VMworld so far has been a blast.  Time to sign off and head to the Welcome Reception, where a select few will receive a very special VMwareTips.com polo shirt, button and VMnut sticker!

      <span style="color: black;">Dear Rick,</p> 
      
      <p>
        Congratulations!  You have successfully passed the VMware Certified Professional beta exam on vSphere4 (VCP4).  A formal score report will be sent to you via Pearson VUE the week after VMworld.  You are receiving this notice because you have been identified as an attendee of VMworld 2009 in San Francisco.  You should have received a notice on how to pick up a &#8220;Hello Certification&#8221; button at the time of registration.  These are only for VCP4s if others are asking.  Please stop by the Testing Room in the San Francisco Marriott (Club Room) for an additional gift! </span>
      </p>
      
      <p class="MsoNormal">
        This gift and the button are exclusive to VMworld 2009 attendees who have passed the beta exam or pass the VCP4 exam at the event.
      </p>
      
      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Thank you for your valuable contribution to the VCP4 beta exam and your continued support of VMware.
      </p>
      
      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Kind Regards,
      </p>
