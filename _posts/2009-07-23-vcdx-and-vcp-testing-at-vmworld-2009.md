Jon Hall from VMware Certification wrote a <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/thread/222194?tstart=0" target="_blank">post</a> on the VMTN Communities page the other day, which <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/07/23/vcdx-enterprise-administration-and-design-exams-available-at-vmworld-2009/" target="_blank">Duncan Epping</a> made me aware of.

> VMware will be providing onsite testing services at VMworld 2009. A great deal is available on the VCP exam (see my post at <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/thread/222191?tstart=0" target="_blank">http://communities.vmware.com/thread/222191?tstart=0</a>), but more importantly, the VCDX Enterprise Administration and Design Exams will be offered! You must be pre-authorized to take these exams, so if you are already in process to take the Enterprise Administration Exam, contact <certification@vmware.com> to inquire about the availability of the exam at VMworld. You can register at Pearson VUE for the Design Exam, but again you must already be in process and have authorization from VMware to take the exam. The link for registering with Pearson for the Design Exam is <a href="http://pearsonvue.com/vmware/vmworld/" target="_blank">http://pearsonvue.com/vmware/vmworld/</a> . For the Enterprise Administration Exam only, you must contact us directly.

This reminded me that I still haven&#8217;t heard from VMware on the results of my VCDX Design Exam beta.  I was really hoping that I would receive my passing grade (hopeful huh?) and schedule the defense during VMworld.

Well, I called Tina (she&#8217;s so famous now!) at VMware and chatted about this.  She sounded hopeful that the results would be sent out by end of business tomorrow (Friday 7/24).  She also informed me that in addition to VCP and VCDX exams being available at VMworld, that VMware will also be scheduling VCDX Defense sessions during the week.  Great news!

<a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/07/23/vcdx-enterprise-administration-and-design-exams-available-at-vmworld-2009/" target="_blank">Duncan</a> also had this to say on his blog post,

> For those who want to do the Enterprise Exam check the mock exam that has also has just been released: <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/quiz.cfm?item=11292" target="_blank">Enterprise Administration Mock Exam</a>.

> Dave Convery also posted about <a href="http://www.dailyhypervisor.com/2009/07/21/discounted-exams-available-at-vmworld/" target="_blank">discounts</a> for these exams, which might be a nice incentive to get you guys studying!
