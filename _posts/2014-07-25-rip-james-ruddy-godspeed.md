****UPDATE:** VMworld 2014 is coming up, and to show support for our fallen team member we&#8217;ll be wearing special bracelets in his honor. You could get your bracelet at the <a href="http://tweetvite.com/event/v0dgeball2014" target="_blank">#v0dgeball</a> game on Sunday afternoon, or throughout the week by finding me at the show. 

Late Wednesday night (July 23, 2014) the world was robbed an amazing man. <a href="https://twitter.com/Darth_Ruddy" target="_blank">James Ruddy</a> was one of the most intelligent, loving and respectful men that I had the pleasure of knowing. I had the amazing opportunity to work with him as a member of Team 1 of the vSpecialist team, here is a great photo of us upon the completion of our Geek Week.

Jim, you will be missed. My prayers to your family and friends during this tragic time. You are a true friend and Godspeed.

A memorial fund in Jim&#8217;s name has been create to assist his lovely wife Stephanie as she now faces the challenges that come with raising their children. Stephanie and Jim shared a love for life and for each other. This is our chance to show her how much the community loves and supports her in this difficult time.
  
Please find it in your heart to help, <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/jimruddymemorialfund/fundraiser/crystallowe" target="_blank">https://www.crowdrise.com/jimruddymemorialfund/fundraiser/crystallowe</a>

For those who want to pay their respects to Jim, the Wake is from 4-8PM Wednesday at Spear Funeral Home 39 South Benson Rd, Fairfield, CT 06824. (just off the post rd by the Bobs shopping center). The Mass is at St Thomas Church 1719 Post Rd, Fairfield CT 06824 on Thursday at 10:00am.
