  Hey there you Linux (or Mac)Â Users! <strong>vm</strong>ware Labs has released another fling, with RVC you can now manage your vSphere environment using your Linux or Mac CLI! RVC is built on Ruby (RbVmomi bindings to the vSphere API) and will require at least Ruby 1.8.7+ to run, the preferred version of Ruby is 1.9.2. The RVC is extremely simple to install and start using. You can download the code right now from <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/rvc" target="_blank">http://labs.vmware.com/flings/rvc</a>. As the development team states in the fling, &#8220;RVC doesn&#8217;t (yet) have every feature vSphere Client does, but for common tasks it can be much more efficient than clicking through a GUI.&#8221; this is still pretty darn cool and will allow you to potentially script some basic vSphere tasks with an extremely small Ruby footprint!
