Day 0 is over and the official first day of VMworld 2010 is upon us. As I type this I&#8217;m getting ready to head over to Moscone for the first general session of VMworld 2010 and am excited to see what this day brings.

With that said, I wanted to do a quick recap of the past couple days.  It would be an understatement to say that I&#8217;ve been busy. vSpecialist core meetings, tweet-ups, meeting with customers, VCE parties&#8230;.it&#8217;s all in a days work.

The biggest highlights so far have to be the VCDX Appreciation Party where I received my _branded_ VCDX #21 <a href="http://twitpic.com/2jub78" target="_blank">leather jacket</a>, then some private meetings with VMware CTO <a href="http://twitpic.com/2jpumb" target="_blank">Steve Herrod</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/herrod" target="_blank">@herrod</a>) and Acadia CEO <a href="http://twitpic.com/2jpi7q" target="_blank">Michael Capellas</a>&#8230;&#8230;and then there was a gorilla.



Needless to say I absolutely love the team of vSpecialists I work with, they are the most amazing group of people in the I/T industry.  And as the video says&#8230;.we get the job done!
