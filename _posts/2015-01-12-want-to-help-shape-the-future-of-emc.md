A friend and fellow VCDX, <a href="https://twitter.com/bmaltz" target="_blank">Brad Maltz</a>, is currently working in the EMC Office of the CTO as the Senior Director of Converged Infrastructure. As he works on laying out our strategics and product development efforts he would like to reach out to the masses, the real world, our customers and ask them&#8230; What do you have? What do you want?   So, our ask is simple&#8230; spend a couple of minutes answering a brief questionnaire and in result you not only will be helping shape the future of our endeavors but you may also win an awesome prize.

Here is the excerpt from <a href="http://www.cloudywhenvirtual.com/?p=46" target="_blank">Brad&#8217;s blog</a> with the details and link:

> So far I have been in this role at EMC for over 6 months and I am loving it. Being on the inside of EMC now has given me exposure to the crazy amounts of awesome, talented and “wicked smaht” people that work here. Of course with all of the cool things I am working on, there is always the need to continue to gather feedback/research from our customers and friends. This data that we need to collect helps us to drive our future products in the best possible direction for our customers to power their applications and workloads. The industry is going through many changes, and EMC is helping to drive these changes but we need your help.
> 
> I have developed a short survey to collect some basic information on your Data Center Technologies and Configurations. The survey is less than 10 minutes long, but the really cool thing is I will be giving away prizes to 3 randomly chosen people (Employees and Federation Members Excluded from Giveaways). That is of course if you want to give your contact information, which is **not** mandatory.
> 
> So if you have a few minutes, please fill out this survey and help to drive EMC products of the future.
