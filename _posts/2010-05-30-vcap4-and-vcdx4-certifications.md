Well here is some information that could help you with your planning. VMware has recently made public some changes to their certifications program.

As many of you already knew there is the VCP certification which requires taking a VMware Approved class as well as passing the VCP exam (currently <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2010/05/28/vmware-certified-professional-vsphere-4-study-guide/" target="_blank">VCP410</a>).Â Then early last year they added the VCDX3 program which requires a VCP but also adds in two exams (Enterprise Administration and Design) as well as a submitting a VCDX Application (design document) and then sitting through a defense.

For vSphere4 they&#8217;ve added a new certification track, VMware Certified Advanced Professional (VCAP4) with two available specialties, Data Center Administration (DCA) and Data Center Design (DCD). If you haven&#8217;t already guessed it they are basically the _upgrades_to the Enterprise Administration and Design Exam necessary for the VCDX3. The problem was that many people wanted to take that next step in their virtualization education and certification, but unless you&#8217;re a pre-sales engineer for a partner or a systems architect the need of obtaining a VCDX is low (unless you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.2vcps.com/2010/05/25/you-might-be-a-vdiva-if/" target="_blank">vDiva</a> like me).

So what does that mean if you&#8217;ve already taken the VCDX3 Enterprise Administration and Design Exam? Not to worry, there is an upgrade path for those of you that have already started your journey (or already have a VCDX3). Simply take the VCAP4-DCD exam when it is made available (around August) and you&#8217;ll be qualified to obtain the VCDX4 (or will be upgraded if you&#8217;ve already obtained a VCDX3). The chart on the right highlights your certification options and the path you would take depending on where you&#8217;re at. The * denotes the exam will be available at a discounted price.

The VCAP4-DCA exam will be available around mid-July and the VCAP4-DCD exam around the August time-frame. VCDX4 defenses will still happen at VMware global events (VMworld, PEX, etc). But now you have almost endless options and certification choices when it comes to VMware.
