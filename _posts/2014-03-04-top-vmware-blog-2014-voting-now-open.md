Ok, so not as critical as political voting but still just as exciting is the yearly vSphere-Land top blog voting that happens each year.

Well, it&#8217;s that time of year again. The vLaunchPad Top 50 on vSphere-Land is up for grabs and I really hope that I get to stay in the running!  I know that my content has declined over the past years, but hopefully the readers still out there enjoy the resources that I continue to deliver.  Also, there are a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TON</strong></span> of exciting other blogs out there that deserve the recognition.

So, what will happen? Will <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com" target="_blank">Duncan</a> keep his #1 title for another year? Will someone else in the top 5 drop out of the running? Will a newcomer be presented into the top 10?
  
The decisions are up to you! I just hope that you vote for me, and also check out some other great blogs while in the process.

Vote Early and Vote Often!  Voting ends on March 17th and results will be revealed on a special live podcast.
