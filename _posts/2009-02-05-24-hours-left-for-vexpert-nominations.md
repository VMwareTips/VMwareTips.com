You only have 24 hours left to submit a nomination for VMware&#8217;s vExpert Award. Here is some information on the vExpert Award from VMTN:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">

If you would like to apply yourself or nomination someone for consideration, the deadline for applications is 11:59PM California time, Friday, February 6, 2009.
