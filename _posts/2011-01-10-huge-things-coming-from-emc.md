Although I cannot publicly discuss any of the _huge things_ coming, I can invite you to register for our launch event on Tuesday, January 18th. I can guarantee you will be amazed of what we&#8217;re announcing and you will not be let down&#8230;.as the marketing campaign says **Records will be broken!
  
** 

I invite everyone, even our competitors to register for the launch event. To register visit <a href="http://emc.im/fggQGg " target="_blank">http://emc.im/fggQGg</a>
