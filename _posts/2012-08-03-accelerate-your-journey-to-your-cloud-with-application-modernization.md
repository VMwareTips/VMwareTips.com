      Please <a href="https://emcinformation.com/74504/REG/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.ashx?reg_src=WEB_Blog_VMware_Tips" target="_blank">join me</a>on Thursday, August 16th at 8:00am PT as I talk about the Journey to full IT as a Service (ITaaS).Most people think that ITaaS stops at Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the reality of this is that simply providing a end-user portal for rapid provisioning really doesn&#8217;t help us solve the problems of legacy applications and frameworks.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is not the end of the Journey to Your Cloud. Although IT Automation and Orchestration is critical to a successful ITaaS deployment, you need to modernize applications to make your business truly cloud ready. Application mobility is essential for business agility, simply virtualizing your J2EE stack or legacy applications isnâ€™t enough. <a href="https://emcinformation.com/74504/REG/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.ashx?reg_src=WEB_Blog_VMware_Tips" target="_blank">Join me</a> to learn to modernize your applications for mobility and for the influx of Big Data.</p>
