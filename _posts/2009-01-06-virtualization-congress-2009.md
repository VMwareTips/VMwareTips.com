Most of you already know that Alessandro Perilli from <a href="http://www.Virtualization.Info" target="_blank">Virtualization.Info</a> is putting on the <a href="http://www.virtualizationcongress.com/" target="_blank">Virtualization Congress</a> event in Las Vegas this upcoming May.  Like many others I&#8217;ve submitted a paper during the call for papers, what&#8217;s unique about this conference is that people can vote for the topics they want to check out.  The most popular will be presenting.

My session has been posted and is available for voting, please check it out <a href="http://cfp.virtualizationcongress.com/items/Designing_a_Stable_Virtual_Infrastructure" target="_blank">This Link</a>

There are a ton of other sessions all available for review and voting as well, those can be found on the Call for Papers site; <a href="http://cfp.virtualizationcongress.com/" target="_blank">http://cfp.virtualizationcongress.com/</a>

Good luck to the other potential presenters, regardless of the results of my session I am still excited to attend and meet other virtualization freaks. :)

Thanks!
