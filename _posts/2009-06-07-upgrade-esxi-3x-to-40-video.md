This is the 2nd of the vSphere Upgrade video set. In this video I will cover how to upgrade you ESXi hosts with VMware Update Manager. Upgrading your ESX hosts should only be done after you have successfully upgraded your vCenter Server to 4.0, an instructional video on how to upgrade your vCenter Server from version 2.5 to 4.0 can be [found here](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/06/01/upgrade-vmware-vcenter-25-to-40-video/).

You will need your VMware vSphere licenses after you upgrade your ESX hosts with Update Manager, by default they revert to the evaluation license &#8211; you can easily add the ESX license in your vSphere Client.
