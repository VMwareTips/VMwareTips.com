****Sad to hear that NetApp Accelerate has been canceled.Â  You can definitely tell our economy isn&#8217;t doing too good when conferences like these are canceled. You can read the official NetApp statement on the cancellation on <a href="http://www.netapp.com/accelerate" target="_blank">their website</a>.
