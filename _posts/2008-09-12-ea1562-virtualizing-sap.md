If your attending VMworld 2008 and your planning on Virtualizing SAP, I&#8217;d highly recommend checking out my Breakout Session.

**Abstract:** An advanced look on how the city of San Diego utilizes VMware Virtual Infrastructure and NetApp NFS storage for this mission critical application. We will discuss the basics of building a solid Virtual Infrastructure that meets your Business Continuity and Disaster Recover needs, along with some tips and tricks including; 5 Second Restores, Data Deduplication and Automated Disaster Recovery.

This will be the only customer ran SAP based breakout session at VMworld, I&#8217;m also going to cover some good reasons why everyone should be running on NFS datastores, specifically with NetApp appliances!
