Let me first say how jealous I am to all of you that are in Cannes, France right now.  Not only are you in a part of the world that I would like to visit, you are also surrounded with everything Virtualization!  What more could you ask for!?

Well, unfortunetely I&#8217;m not going to have much to talk about in regards to VMworld Europe, but there are tons of other websites that I will be watching for all the latest information.  I&#8217;d like to provide this list to you to add to your watch list:
