The EMC vSpecialist EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) team has finally submitted their answer to the vSpecialist Americas team hit song <a href="http://youtu.be/DdSLc68J210" target="_blank"><em>vSpecialists Delight</em></a>_, &#8220;EMC is Number One!&#8221;_Â  was just released and I think it&#8217;ll be an instant hit! The song is extremely catchy and even includes cameos from some virtualization superstars such as <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/" target="_blank">Duncan Epping</a>. This really is the icing on the cake for me, it really shows how much fun we&#8217;re having working on such an amazing team. We work really hard, but obviously we play just as hard!

2011 is going to be an amazing year and we&#8217;re just getting started!
