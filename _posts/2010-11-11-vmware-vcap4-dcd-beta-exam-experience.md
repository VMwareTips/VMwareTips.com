Just like <a href="http://www.boche.net/blog/index.php/2010/11/10/vmware-vcap4-dcd-beta-exam-experience/" target="_blank">Jason Boche</a> and <a href="http://jfvi.co.uk/2010/11/09/vcap-dcd-beta-experience/" target="_blank">Chris Dearden</a> I was able to take part in the VCAP4-DCD Beta experience. I took my exam in San Diego on Tuesday (11/9) which was a lot nicer than having to drive up to Orange County like I did for the DCA exam.

Both Jason and Chris did great write-ups on it, the exam was 131 questions and they gave you 3hrs 45mins to complete. The first portion is the NDA acceptance then on to a questionnaire asking you to set your level of understanding. The test had three different types of questions, including;

  1. Traditional Multiple Choice (select 1, 2 or 3 of many)
  2. Visio-like tool to create architecture drawings
  3. GUI style tool where you drag options and drop them on answers

I was able to finish the exam with about 15 minutes to spare, and luckily for me I answer every single question as I was surprised to see no options for going back to review after you finished. I did think I would have a final opportunity to provide input at the end of the exam, but unfortunately I was not presented with that option but I did leave some good feedback on questions that were incorrect or if I felt were unnecessary. A few of the questions did require vendor specific knowledge, I answered these to the best of my ability but left comments that I do not think having vendor specific questions is a good idea for this style of exam. Oh BTW, the Visio style tool is a LOT better than the one in the VCDX3 Design Exam&#8230;.but it does take a little time getting use to it!

I did not have any fun confrontations with the Pearson staff like Jason did, but I did get into a good discussion about security with a Pearson employee about their new &#8220;Palm Vein Scanning Device&#8221; that they&#8217;re pushing over traditional finger prints. Pretty cool stuff as it ensures identity protection but keeps their information database unappealing to law enforcement (for e-discovery types of things &#8211; ie: you leave finger prints at crime scenes, not vein layouts).

Anyways, I feel like I did fairly well &#8211; it was a good experience and the information in the <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/register.cfm?course=76644" target="_blank">blueprint</a> was extremely helpful in my preparation.  I&#8217;m excited to see what my results are, if I pass I obtain the DCD certification as well as an upgrade to VCDX4.
