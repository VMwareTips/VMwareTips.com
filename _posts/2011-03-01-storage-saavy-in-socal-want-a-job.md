At EMC we&#8217;re constantly growing&#8230;and with the launch of our VNX and VNXe storage lines, we&#8217;re growing like CRAZY!

So here&#8217;s a calling for all of you storage geeks out there&#8230;.

Are you storage saavy? Not necessarily EMC, but perhaps NetApp, 3PAR, Compellent, HDS or IBM and want to work with a great team of storage specialists, learn all of the latest and greatest things from EMC and have fun while doing it all?

Currently in the Southern California area we have opened up a few new requisitions and are actively looking for some great talent to come on board! So if you are in the Los Angeles, Orange or San Diego County area please shoot me a message and I&#8217;ll get you in touch with a hiring manager ASAP!
