Duncan over at <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/02/05/vcdx-design-exam-available-end-february/" target="_blank">Yellow-Bricks</a> came across a response on the <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/thread/171918?tstart=0&start=30" target="_blank">VMTN forums</a> from Jon Hall, Technical Certification Developer at VMware, in regards to the VCDX Design Exam (step 3 of 4). Looks like the third portion of the highly anticipated VCDX Certification will be available around the end of February.Â  Hopefully when I get the results on the <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/02/04/vcdx-enterprise-administration-exam-complete/" target="_blank">Enterprise Exam</a> Tina will let me schedule this next portion.

  <em>Hello,</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>The Design Exam will be available by the end of this month. Keep in mind that once the exam is officially announced there is likely to be limited initial availability. It was always our plan to release this exam following the release of the Enterprise Admin Exam, since you must take the Enterprise Exam before you take the Design Exam. Unfortunately, the technical requirements for the Enterprise Admin Exam took some time to implement, which pushed the Design Exam release back.</em>

  <em>Regards,</em>
