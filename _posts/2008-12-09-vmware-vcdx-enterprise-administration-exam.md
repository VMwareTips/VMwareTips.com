I finally received an email this afternoon from VMware in regards to the VCDX exam, it finally sounds like they&#8217;ve gotten it straightened out with Pearson VUE on how it will work.  Not to mention they are asking me to schedule a time to take the Exam!

Basically you need to be invited to take the VCDX Exam. The VCDX certification is a multi-step process, most importantly you will need to be a VCP 3.x (those of you who are still VCP in 2.5 will need to take the VCP3 test).  Then you will need to take the VCDX Qualification Review (<a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrSurvey/feedback.cfm?survey=4583&poll=0&mL_method=overview&senderURL=none&senderDesc=none&ui=Full&user=0" target="_blank">link</a>), this is then reviewed by the VMware Education department.  Upon their approval they will coordinate with you a scheduled time to take the VCDX Enterprise Administration Exam &#8211; when you complete and pass that you then take the Design Exam then finally after all that you present and defend a successful VMware Infrastructure design and implementation plan.  All of these steps can be found on the VMware website (<a href="http://mylearn1.vmware.com/portals/certification//" target="_blank">link</a>).

So most of us already know the steps, but what we didn&#8217;t know is how it was going to work.  From the look of it today (based on the email I received), once VMware approves you for the first step (VCDX Enterprise Administration Exam) they will coordinate a time and place for you to take it.  Unlike the VCP exam you cannot contact Pearson VUE directly, this must be done by VMware.

One other thing I&#8217;ve been hearing is that there will only be around 40 VCDX&#8217;s initially, and secondly the final step of where you present a design and defend it&#8211;this is done in front of a panel of VCDX&#8217;s, of which you will join upon successful completion of the VCDX certification.

More information can be found <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/portals/certification/faqs.cfm?ui=www#1871" target="_blank">&#8220;here&#8221;</a> &#8211; or by emailing vcdx@vmware.com.

Also, Duncan over at <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2008/12/09/study-guide-for-vcdx-enterprise-exam-35/" target="_blank">Yellow-Bricks.com</a> posted a very good study guide for the VCDX Admin Exam, which is actually from a VMTN posting by Peter van den Bosch. <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/1118727-16763/VMware%20Enterprise%20Administration%20Exam%20study%20guide%203.pdf" target="_blank">It can be found here.</a>
