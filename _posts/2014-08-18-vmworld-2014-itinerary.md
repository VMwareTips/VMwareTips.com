That&#8217;s pretty much how the week goes at VMworld, and here we are, encroaching on what will be my 11th VMworld conference. It&#8217;s a week full of education, networking, giveaways, fun and opportunity!  VMworld really packs it all in, and I&#8217;m proud to be part of it again this year.

Below is my itinerary for the week, the sessions I&#8217;m planning on hitting, the parties and TweetUp I plan to visit. I also throw in some other must-see sessions and some cool vendors to check out.

I look forward to seeing all of my vHomies out in San Francisco, for those attending in EMEA I&#8217;m sorry to say that I will not be joining this year, we&#8217;re expecting our twin boys in early November so flights for me are grounded![](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif "More...") around that time. Perhaps next year!  If you&#8217;re going to be in SFO next week, find me, say HI, give me a hug&#8230; you might even get a cool VMwareTips gift ;)

BTW, the parties/events listed below are just a small fraction of what&#8217;s going on.  These events are where you&#8217;ll most likely see me, but be sure to check out the full list here <a href="http://bit.ly/vmworld2014parties" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/vmworld2014parties</a>

Safe travels, see you all next week!<!--more-->

The different functions of VMware NSX will be shown. Attendees will gain a firm understanding of how to utilize the components such as distributed firewall, distributed routing, load balancers, edge services, and 3rd party security integration. Also covered in detail are the technical requirements and steps to implement the SDN framework in to the physical networking and virtualization environment along with best practices and deployment recommendations.</em>

Virtual Volumes has been talked about at several VMworlds now and as it is finally coming out next year, you may be wondering: Is it real? What can it do for me? Virtual Volumes (vVOLs) will change how we think about storage management in customer environments, including private and hybrid cloud configurations. In this joint EMC and VMware session you will learn about unique use cases in which storage management is much more streamlined & powerful. Find out how EMC is implementing Virtual Volumes across the broad range of storage offerings and how its integrated storage management portfolio. Learn about details on new storage management policies abstractions and specifications. For example, learn how feature like EMC FAST are better able to optimize application performance when used with Virtual Volumes. We will also talk about how VPLEX will be able to manage VM availability and placement more optimally using VVOLs. Finally, VVOL provides ease of management, increased flexibility and greater resilience by leveraging a more granular storage provisioning to enable new agile and available storage infrastructure. In this session, EMC and VMware will share what all these means to you.</em>

In this interactive design workshop, we&#8217;ll go through some of the most common challenges we see customers facing when moving towards the next generation of virtualization. Considerations will be made including management, backups, storage, & networking.</em>

      <em>Server-local storage has made a comeback in recent years, motivated by the popularity of large-scale distributed computing environments and made viable by the large storage capacities built into today&#8217;s servers. VMware&#8217;s VSAN allows us to aggregate all local storage in a cluster into a single datastore and present it for use by VMs running on any server in the cluster. Applications can use this clustered storage without any knowledge of the underlying storage hardware or the physical location of data objects within this storage. Needless to say, this shift in storage paradigm demands that we re-assess application performance.</em>

Do you want make use of your existing investments in a rational way; as you build up your datacenter’s capabilities? Perhaps you are a solutions architect wanting to offer competitive bids by not re-implementing (and re-deploying) every wheel in the shop. Legacy does not mean broken! VMWare’s vCloud Automation Center (vCAC) was designed from the ground up to be extended. vCAC allows you to orchestrate, coordinate, and govern the services and building blocks of your existing and planned data center as it evolves to meet tomorrow&#8217;s changing business needs. In this Deep Dive, we’ll show how you can make use of existing appliances and investments when deploying Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) with vCAC. We will elaborate on how we’ve built our orchestration platform to interoperate with existing assets. Many of our customers employ management solutions to plan, track, and manage internal Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) processes. We will show how you can seamlessly integrate with already-deployed management solutions, demonstrating vCAC’s innate and flexible extensibility mechanisms.</em>

And how those design choices enables the on demand deployment of the multi-tiers application stack. The specific referance design covers three essential topics 1) Properties of NSX components 2) Design consideration with NSX components such as distributed routing, distributed fire wall, interaction with physical networking for routing and bridging and 3) Orchestration/Automation using vCloud Automation Center with NSX.</em>
