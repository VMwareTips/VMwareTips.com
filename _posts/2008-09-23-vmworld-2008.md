I guess I should start writing about VMworld 2008 and my experiences. I really should have started this while I was there and fresh in my mind. Overall it was a decent show, some good sessions and tons of parties and social mixers to meet people that enjoy virtualization as much as I do.

One thing that did disappoint me was the VMware Futures discussions and the lack of new technology presented at the conference. For the most part there were things that a lot of we already knew about, including some applications/features that were presented last year but renamed for this year (Continuous Availability = Fault Tolerance).

I&#8217;ll be working on this post over the next day or so, in the mean-time enjoy some VMworld photos. [album id="1" template="compact"]
