  As featured today in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2009/snapshots/1.html" target="_blank">Fortune Magazine</a>, NetApp was announced to be the #1 Best Company to Work for in 2009.  This is not surprising, their work ethics and benefits speak for themselves &#8211; all the employees I&#8217;ve ever talked with are always upbeat and extremely happy doing what their doing.  Congratulations to NetApp!

    Employee enthusiasm for the legendary egalitarian culture helped catapult NetApp to No. 1 after six years on our list.Typical of its down-to-earth management ethos, NetApp early on ditched a travel policy a dozen ­pages long in favor of this maxim: &#8220;We are a frugal company. But don&#8217;t show up dog-tired to save a few bucks. Use your common sense.&#8221; Rather than business plans, many units write &#8220;future histories,&#8221; imagining where their business will be a year or two out.</p>

      And the benefits are tops: five paid days for volunteer work, $11,390 adoption aid, and autism coverage &#8212; used by 43 employees since 2006 at a cost of $242,452. The company has gained market share during the slump, hasn&#8217;t had layoffs, and has more than $2 billion in cash on hand to help it ride out the global financial crisis.
