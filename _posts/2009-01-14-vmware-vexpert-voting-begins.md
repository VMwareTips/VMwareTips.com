In the twitter world today we found out that the VMware VVP (VMware Virtualization Professional Program) is officially called vExpert. Also heard that voting begins this evening on it.  Maybe I can skip my VCDX exam if I earn the title vExpert?

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Correction -> Even though I thought nominee&#8217;s have been submitted long before today, John Troyer in a comment below says that they are finally going to come in this evening. Then the selected panel goes into a room and votes, when the white smoke comes out of the chimney the vExperts have been selected.  Thanks John!</strong></span>
