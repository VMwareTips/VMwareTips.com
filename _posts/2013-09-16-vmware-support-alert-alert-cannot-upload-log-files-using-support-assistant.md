In our effort to provide our viewers with up to the minute information on VMware related news and topics, we&#8217;re posting the following Special Alert direct from VMware Support Insider.

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" title="alert" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/tp/.a/6a00d8341c328153ef01543330c84d970c-800wi" alt="" width="86" height="86" />Due to a change in the support request file upload process, VMware Support Assistant 5.1 temporarily cannot be used to upload files. For more details, see knowledge base article: </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2059759" target="_blank">VMware Support Assistant 5.1 will fail to upload log files (2059759)</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">.

Support requests can still be filed through Support Assistant, but you must use a temporary manual FTP process to upload files to VMware Technical Support.
