Just received some exciting news from VMware,  my two submissions have been approved and are scheduled for VMworld 2009!   Looks like I have some work ahead of me.  One of the sessions will actually be an Ask the Experts panel discussion.   More information to follow, but here is what I received from VMware:

> Dear Rick,
> 
> Congratulations! The session proposal below has been accepted for VMworld 2009, taking place August 31- September 3 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, CA.
> 
> Session ID: TA2259
  
> Session Title: Ask the Experts &#8211; Virtualization Design
  
> Track: Technology and Architecture
> 
> Session ID: TA2262
  
> Session Title: vSphere Enterprise Stability &#8211; It&#8217;s all in the Design

I&#8217;m planning on putting together an Expert Panel of VM-Guru&#8217;s for the Ask the Experts session &#8212; so some of you may expect to hear from me soon!
