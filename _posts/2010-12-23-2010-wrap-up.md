Wow, where has the time gone? It seems like it was just yesterday that I was dabbling with VMware GSX to give some extra workstations to application developers, that was over 7 years ago. Now I&#8217;m working for a Fortune 500 company doing what I love more than anything, talking about wickedly cool stuff!

2010 has been an amazing ride, probably the best year of my life and it&#8217;s just the beginning. Beautiful brand new home, a new job working for the best company with the best people in the industry, a new addition to the family (our puppy <a href="http://twitpic.com/3a520b" target="_blank">Chloe</a>), good health and overall happiness.

The holiday season is a great time to reflect back and to be thankful for all that you have and have done. With that I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_blank">Chad Sakac</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/wadeoharrow" target="_blank">Wade O&#8217;Harrow</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/vcemonster" target="_blank">Jeff Thomas</a> for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime. I&#8217;d like to thank my beautiful partner <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1692417913" target="_blank">Mandy</a> for putting up with me and things we&#8217;ve dealt with this year (home-ownership, traveling for business and for just putting up with me :)). And finally I&#8217;d like to thank my readers, for continuing to visit the website and for sticking with me even though the amount of content has dwindled &#8211; I promise, one of my Resolutions for 2011 is to change my ways and get some more quality content online!

With that I feel I must follow in year-end blog tradition and post my thoughts on what&#8217;s to come in 2011.

  * <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">2009 2010</span> 2011 will be the year of Virtual Desktops (VDI)
  * The way we think about networking will change (OTV, FCoE)
  * The way we think about storage will change (Storage Pools, Auto Tiering, HUGE Cache footprints)
  * The way we deploy virtualization will change (<a href="http://www.vce.com" target="_blank">Vblock</a>)
  * Mixed workload deployment (Private and Public Cloud)

Those are some high level thoughts and frankly I could dive deeply into each one of those things, but to some things up I&#8217;ll try to make it really simple. Things are going to get really easy for administrators and end-users alike and things are going to get real dynamic. We&#8217;re moving back to the mainframe days, there will be _datacenter administrators_ that manage our _virtual infrastructures_ which consists of compute, storage and network. Each one of these pieces inherently will simplify as well (flat converged networks, automated tiered storage and web portals for public consumption just to name a few). However, we will not leverage this internal (private) cloud for everything, some things can sit out in the external (public) cloud in an effort to be more elastic and cost effective. Then at the end of this is end-user accessibility (or mobility), in terms of VDI we&#8217;ll see the adoption of many different end-points (thin, thick, mobile, tablet, etc) giving access to a centralize desktop from anywhere. Because in the end the world is full of consumers who want what they want, when they want.

So there you have it, simple consumption, simple administration, simple design and even simplicity in deployment through complete stack offerings like the <a href="http://www.vce.com" target="_blank">Vblock</a>. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some time to deep dive into each one of these things individually as they really are all amazing technologies.

With that I&#8217;m going to shut &#8216;er down for a few days and enjoy the holidays. May you and your family have a happy and healthy holiday and New Year!
