I got about 20 hours until I take the VCDX Design Exam, and you know what&#8230;I&#8217;m not that nervous.  I was lot more nervous about the Enterprise Administration Exam.  Perhaps it was the $200 discount I received on this test, or maybe I&#8217;m just confident because of everything I&#8217;ve heard about it?

From what I hear the only real thing you need for this exam is true experience. You need to know how to design a full virtual infrastructure from front to back. I&#8217;ve done so many that perhaps it is just second nature for me.  Still doesn&#8217;t hurt to study what you can though!

I&#8217;ve been reading the <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/lcms/mL_faq/2256/DesignExamBlueprint.pdf" target="_blank">VCDX Design Exam Blueprint</a> as well as some guides on VMware Partner Central;

  * VMware Business Continuity Jumpstart
  * VMware Plan and Design
  * VMware Virtualization Assessment
  * VMware Operational Readiness Accelerator Kit

Thanks to <a href="http://www.virtualtroll.com/?p=132" target="_blank">VirtualTroll.com</a> for providing the above suggestion. I really believe this exam covers the true details of creating a robust, reliable and redundant virtual infrastructure&#8230;.anyone with thorough systems architecture and virtualization experience should not have a problem with this exam&#8230;but only time will tell for me!

I will be sure to publish my thoughts on the test as soon as I complete it.  Wish me luck!
