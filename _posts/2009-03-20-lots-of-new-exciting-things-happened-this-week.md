Hey people, sorry the site hasn&#8217;t been as active as it has in the past, I wanted to at least provide you with a weekly update.  As most of you know, I&#8217;m the Technical Editor for Scott Lowe&#8217;s upcoming book, this has taken up a good majority of my free time. Also things are crazy busy in local government right now, I&#8217;ve been working 50-60 hour weeks.  This hasn&#8217;t left me with much free time to do anything.  I haven&#8217;t signed on to Twitter in a couple days, I missed this weeks VMTN Roundtable&#8230; I feel so out of the loop!



So, first off was the product review and demo I was suppose to do of Rove Mobile Admin, more information on this can be found [here](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/03/20/rove-mobile-admin-42-vmware-vcenter-support-added/).

Then there was the announcement Cisco finally made on Project California, now officially their <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/data_center/unifiedcomputing_promo.html?POSITION=sl&COUNTRY_SITE=us&CAMPAIGN=Data+Center+CA&CREATIVE=dccalaunch&REFERRING_SITE=CISCO.COM+INDEX" target="_blank">Unified Computing System</a> (UCS).  This is a big jump for Cisco, getting into the x86 blade server market and teaming up with VMware to provide virtualization&#8230;none of this is really any &#8220;new&#8221; news, but it is now official. I wonder who is OEM&#8217;ing their server hardware, I wonder if they&#8217;re a contender in the purchase of Sun Microsystems?   What about the possibility of Cisco purchasing EMC?  This is something they&#8217;ve been saying for <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/column/0,294698,sid5_gci1102991,00.html#" target="_blank">over 4 years now</a>,

Speaking of purchases, Sun Microsystems is up for grabs, it appears that IBM may want a <a href="http://www.thevarguy.com/2009/03/18/ibm-targeting-sun-for-takeover-linux-mysql-potential-winners/" target="_blank">piece of that pie</a>&#8230;my guess, most likely for MySQL and the newer technologies in Solaris 10 (ZFS, DTrace).  I forsee a purchase of Sun by IBM, say goodbye to SPARC, StorageTek and Solaris.  Say hello to MySQL (by IBM), Novell SUSE Linux (with ZFS and DTrace support).   If you didn&#8217;t know, IBM has invested greatly in Novell SUSE, I think they see that RISC is going away and x86 Virtualization is the new mainframe. IBM is going to focus on their x86 offerings, including SUSE, Virtualization and MySQL&#8230;and also their strong relationship with NetApp for their OEM&#8217;d storage products.   But, this is I.T. and things change daily&#8230;and after all, this is only speculation :)
