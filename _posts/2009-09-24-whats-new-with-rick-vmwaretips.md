## VMwareTips and the website&#8230;

Thought I&#8217;d give all of my avid readers an update on VMwareTips and my personal life.  For those of you that attended VMworld 2009 you already know there wasn&#8217;t too many exciting announcements made.  We have VMware View 4 coming with PC over IP (PCoIP), SRM 4 with its NFS support and more hype of the vCloud and VMware Go, a tool for ESXi users to deploy and manage your systems via a web based tool. Expect some write-ups soon on View 4 and SRM 4, those are set to be released before the end of the calendar year.

As of August 2009 we&#8217;ve hit over 70,000 visits per month and over 18,000 unique visitors!  The growth of the site has been phenomenal over the past year and I have no one to thank but my readers!  I pledge to you that the next year will only be better!

Earlier this month Sybex published <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a>&#8216;s masterpiece _&#8220;Mastering VMware vSphere 4&#8221;_which is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Computer-Tech/dp/0470481382" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>. I had the honor to be the technical editor of this great book and I truly feel this is a great tool for those of you just learning VMware vSphere or simply need a quick reference tool.

I&#8217;ve been asked by <a href="http://www.mhprofessional.com/" target="_blank">McGraw-Hill</a> to be the technical editor on an upcoming publication focused on the VCP-410 exam. This book _&#8220;VMware Certified Professional 4 (VCP4) Study Guide&#8221;_should be released by January 2010 and will be available on Amazon.com.  Don&#8217;t forget that the requirements for the VCP4 certification are successful passing of the VCP-410 exam and also sitting through a certified VMware training session.

In what would be the third VMware book I&#8217;ve worked on, Sybex has once again asked me to be a technical editor on <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a>, <a href="http://www.jasemccarty.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jase McCarty</a> and Matthew Johnson&#8217;s upcoming release _&#8220;VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference&#8221;_.  Think of this as a smaller pocket guide of the Mastering book. Perfect for those crunch moments, or perhaps some light bathroom reading? Pre-order now on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/VMware-vSphere-Administration-Instant-Reference/dp/0470520728" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>!

## TrainSignal vSphere Training

David Davis is at it again with the next edition of their popular video based <a href="http://www.trainsignal.com/VMware-vSphere-Training-P76.aspx" target="_blank">VMware training series</a>. TrainSignal has asked me to be the Technical Editor for this product and I promise we&#8217;ll provide nothing but the best video based training available for VMware vSphere.  Also be sure to keep an eye out for the Cisco Nexus 1000V video training which I will be authoring, this will be included in the vSphere series and should be added around mid November.

Most of you already know, via Twitter, but it is official.  I am now a VMware Certified Design Expert (VCDX).  I am one of a few select bunch (< 25), I couldn&#8217;t be happier to be part of this elite crew!
