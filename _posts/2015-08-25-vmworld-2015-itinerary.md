## **_&#8220;Ready for Any&#8221;_**

That&#8217;s the theme for this years massive technology industry conference, aka VMworld.  I say technology conference because VMworld has grown to be much more than just a _virtualization_ forum, it&#8217;s a week that&#8217;s jam packed with technologies that cover every aspect of the common datacenter&#8230; and more importantly, it&#8217;s a week to learn and network with some great people. It&#8217;s a week full of education, networking, giveaways, fun and opportunity!  VMworld really packs it all in, and I&#8217;m proud to be part of it again this year.

Below is my itinerary for the week, the sessions I&#8217;m planning on hitting, the parties and TweetUps I plan to visit. I also throw in some other must-see sessions and some cool vendors to check out.

I look forward to seeing all of my friends out there in San Francisco. If you&#8217;re going to be in SFO next week, find me, say HI, give me a hug&#8230; it&#8217;s always great to put a face with a name.
  
Also, don&#8217;t be shy&#8230; the virtualization community doesn&#8217;t bite and we&#8217;re all super humble and happy to chat with you about anything.  This is an open invitation, if you see me, come say Hi!

BTW, the parties/events listed below are just a small fraction of what&#8217;s going on.  These events are where you&#8217;ll most likely see me, but be sure to check out the full list here <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/en/gatherings.html" target="_blank">http://www.vmworld.com/en/gatherings.html</a>

Safe travels, see you all next week!![](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif "More...")

      <em>As enterprises are furiously competing to maintain relevancy in the market, innovation and business agility are essential aspects of their long-term success. To support that, IT must provide agile, secure, and cost effective services. This is not an easy task, it is critical that you understand the different cloud models and how they correlate to application and business requirements, these are basic fundamentals for your continued success. In this session, we will discuss the Managed Cloud model and how the EMC Federation with Virtustream solutions will complement vCloud Air’s Public Cloud offerings. We will guide you thru the key dimensions you must consider in choosing the right cloud model for your applications. In this session you will also hear about how EMC will enable Cloud Native Apps, the container ecosystem as well as transforming storage and replication through Virtual Volumes and IO Filters. In typical Chad fashion, we’ll get our hands dirty with tons of live demos and we’ll also provide a sneak peek on how Software-Defined Storage solutions are evolving to accommodate these new application and business requirements, from extreme high performance and low latency applications to huge object repositories. You’ll see how you can start using Software-Defined Storage solutions in your environment with just a few simple steps and with no out of pocket cost, by leveraging EMC’s open source offerings.</em>

In this talk, we characterize the performance of running Docker containers on vSphere. We also show that in many applications by running Docker containers in VMs you can get up to 30% better than native performance due to better vSphere scheduling and isolation. We also provide detailed results across a wide variety of micro- benchmarks covering all aspects of the system (CPU, memory, IO and network) and real world workloads like Redis, Web2.0 applications like NGINX web server with MySql and OLTP benchmarks like DvDStore with Postgresql. Finally we share our performance best practices on how to configure Docker containers and VMs for the maximum performance. We also present the results of management operations and show that leveraging VMFork (project Fargo), VMs can provide similar performance in terms of provisioning time and memory overhead when compared to containers.</em>

As momentum builds around Docker and Apache Mesos within engineering teams, it is evident the infrastructure and operations teams need a strategy for offering Apache Mesos internally on a VMware private cloud environment.</em><em>Combining Apache Mesos with Docker as a cell offering within your existing private cloud environment, you are able to leverage a dedicated HDFS data warehouse to leverage against the elastic and on-demand nature of analytic processing jobs. The transient nature of Apache Mesos allows engineers to be more agile in their consumption of physical resources within the private cloud infrastructure.</em><em>One of the largest challenges to offering Apache Mesos within a private cloud environment is rapid deployment and standardized configuration. This presentation will help system architects understand how to utilize existing Open Source projects to customize a framework to offer a dedicated HDFS data warehouse and a preconfigured Mesosphere stack with Apache Mesos, Marathon and Chronos. The automated approach will allow an organization to become more agile in their Platform-as-a-Service offerings within a private cloud environment.</em><em>The presentation will demonstrate similar functionality within a private cloud environment as the Mesosphere offerings for automated deployments into various public cloud environments. Utilizing intelligent cluster deployments, resource are deployed as a single Apache Mesos entity. The ability to rapidly deploy cells will help to decrease adoption time by customers.</em>

In this session we&#8217;ll show you with LIVE DEMOS of tech like VMware Photon, CoreOS, Lattice.cf and Docker how you can eat the cake and have it too, by merging the concepts of virtualization and containers to a great platform for both traditional and new apps, and discuss the difference between managing stateless and stateful apps when it comes to persistence of data.</em>

Any storage related topic is fair game, including all-flash arrays, VVols, SPBM, SIOC, containers, OpenStack, app & VM backup, SRM and much, much more. The Pure Storage VMware community survey provides crowd-sourced answers to questions around real-world use cases, challenges and technology adoption – we will test the vExperts on the survey results to see how well they know their business and how clearly they can explain some of these important topics to the audience! Join us to meet some of the most widely read vExperts and bloggers in the community in what is sure to be the most talked about session of VMworld 2015.</em>

**Must See Vendors at VMworld**

Last year Mirantis, MidoKura, SaltStack, Docker and PLUMgrid really caught my attention at VMworld, this year I have a new list of vendors that have sparked my interest and I will definitely be checking them out.
  
From what you&#8217;ll see, it&#8217;s all about Cloud Native Applications&#8230;how to deploy them, manage them and also do some really cool things. There&#8217;s also some cool cloud based labs out there too!

  * CloudGenix
  * StacksWare
  * ZeroStack
  * Rancher
  * Platform9
  * Qstack
  * Cumulus Networks
  * ClusterHQ
  * Cloud Physics
  * Ravello Systems

So there you go&#8230; A week full of events, sessions, general sessions, parties, vTweetUps and more. This is going to be an amazing week. I can&#8217;t wait to see some old friends and to meet some new ones!

Be sure to find me while at the show, I love meeting new people and reconnecting with old friends, so be sure to keep an eye out on Twitter for my <a href="http://twitter.com/rick_scherer" target="_blank">live tweets</a>.
