The time has come, the official VMware vSphere 4 Launch Event. Special Thanks to <a href="http://www.trainsignal.com" target="_blank">TrainSignal</a> and <a href="http://www.netapp.com/" target="_blank">NetApp</a> for making this possible. For those of you who have not registered for the chance to Win a **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">FREE</span>** TrainSignal VMware ESX Training Kit, please <a href="https://www.vmwaretips.com/contest/register.php" target="_blank">go do so now</a>! Registration to Win will end around 2:00pm PST and the winners announced on this page around 6:00pm PST.

This will be the page where I post all of the up to minute information and videos as I have them available. I will also include my Twitter feed below for easy access.

**Video Broadcasting**





I have a lot of footage I need to go through, roughly 2 hours spread across two cameras&#8230;.not mentioning still photos which have been uploaded to TwitPic.Â  More videos and photos will be posted here as soon as I edit and publish.

**Notes**

The event has been great, the information however wasn&#8217;t as exciting as I would have hoped. John Troyer said it best in a Twitter though, this launch was to target a broad range of audience, typically those who have no clue what vSphere is&#8230;.for those of us internal to the product it wasn&#8217;t going to be anything special. However, VMware CEO Steve Herrod showcased an awesome &#8220;Olympic Torch&#8221; style video showing the Golden Image of vSphere 4.0 &#8211; which is complete! This means that vSphere will be released to market (RTM) sometime this quarter!

I posted a ton of pictures on <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/rick_vmwaretips" target="_blank">TwitPic</a>, and some comments on Twitter, check those out below. A lot of big names in the industry were present; Michael Dell, Joe Tucci, Steve Herrod, John Chambers and a few others were all up on stage at one point in time with Paul Maritz. All in all, the launch has been a great marketing tool for VMware to get the annoucement of vSphere and the Cloud vision &#8212; and you know what, I&#8217;ve always been skeptical about &#8220;The Cloud&#8221; but with vSphere, it really makes sense. Great Job VMware.

I will also work on getting all of my TwitPics into a Flickr group soon too.
