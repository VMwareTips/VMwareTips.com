Well, my article in NetApp&#8217;s Tech OnTap was published this morning.  It was pretty exciting being asked by the #1 Employer in the United States to write an article for their monthly technical magazine.  In this topic I discuss how utilizing NetApp technologies saves my employer time and money. It is a little refreshing for potential customers to hear about success stories from other actual users, rather than sales pitches from account executives.  I invite you to go <a href="http://www.netapp.com/us/communities/tech-ontap/tot-sddpc.html" target="_blank">read my article</a> for yourself, and while your at it &#8211; <a href="http://media.netapp.com/documents/tot0109.pdf" target="_blank">read the entire issue</a>.
