I typically do not post articles related to headline news stories, but this is one of the biggest announcements made by EMC and VMware since Diane Greene was booted from the VMware CEO position.

I&#8217;ll spare you some reading and hit the highlights;

> EMC Q2 2012 financials were announced and they&#8217;re up 10% (~$5.31 Billion) from Q2 2011.
> 
> EMC today also announced a series of senior executive appointments to further position the company for its next phase of growth. The appointments highlight the depth and breadth of EMC&#8217;s executive management team and mark the next step in the implementation of the company&#8217;s long-standing executive succession plan.
> 
> &#8220;EMC and VMware have delivered strong results over the past decade and have developed world-class management teams,&#8221; said Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO.  &#8220;Today we are witnessing an extraordinary transformation in the IT industry unlike anything we have seen before – a major shift to Cloud Computing, Big Data applications and delivering IT-as-a-Service.  To capitalize on this tremendous opportunity we are positioning our executive talent so that we can benefit from their exceptional professional strengths with the goal of further advantaging EMC and VMware to deliver long-term value to our respective shareholders.&#8221;

> Key among the executive appointments to drive future growth, EMC announced that:
>

>     Pat Gelsinger, EMC President and COO of Information Infrastructure Products, has been appointed CEO of VMware (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vmw" target="_blank">VMW</a>), effective September 1st, and will also join the VMware Board of Directors.

> Tucci said, &#8220;With these changes, David will assume responsibility for EMC&#8217;s Information Infrastructure business, Pat will now lead Cloud Infrastructure at VMware, and Paul will look across our technology strategy with a particular focus on Big Data and the next generation of cloud-oriented applications that will be built on top of these foundations.&#8221;
