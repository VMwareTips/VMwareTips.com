<a href="http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/897-Passing-USB-devices-to-the-Virtual-Machines.html" target="_blank">Eric Sloof</a> recently wrote about FabulaTech, which has a product called USB Over Network. This is a very nice software based client/server application that turns a PC with a USB device connected into a USB host &#8211; you can then install the client piece on your Virtual Machine to connect to the hosted USB connection.<img class="alignright" title="anywhereusb" src="http://www.digi.com/images/products/prd_usb_anywhereusb.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="170" />

Digi also has a product called <a href="http://www.digi.com/products/usb/anywhereusb.jsp" target="_blank">AnywhereUSB</a>, it pretty much does the same thing but without the need of a host machine, you plug your USB device into the AnywhereUSB appliance (very small 5 port USB hub) and install the client piece on your Virtual Machine, the connection is made over a 10/100 ethernet line.Â  I&#8217;ve used a couple dozen of these for software that requires a USB License Key, never having a problem with any of them.
