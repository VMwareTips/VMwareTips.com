Today we are pleased to announce the official launch of docs.vmware.com. This portal unifies the product documentation for all VMware products, versions, and languages into a single platform so you can find the information that you are looking for more quickly and easily. VMware products offer a wide range of business solutions from desktop virtualization to supporting your hybrid cloud. We’ve heard your feedback that finding the right information can be difficult. Our search was out of date, the look and feel were not modern, the content was siloed, and the docs were not available on mobile devices. To address these problems, we decided to start from scratch. The design of this site is meant to enable you to better filter content, find relevant answers, and create custom views of information that you can access on any device.

#### Key Features for You

Here are a few features that we hope will help you find the information that you need.

<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">
  It’s All About Search
</h5>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Our site design features search on every page. We built a new search experience powered by Elasticsearch with an intuitive taxonomy to help you more easily locate relevant content. You can search the entire site or a particular book.

</p>

<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Filter to Find What You Need
</h5>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  With tens of thousands of pages of information, you need help reducing the scope of content to the products that you care about. Use the filters to limit your search to particular products, versions, subjects or information types.
</p>

</p>

<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Create Custom Docs Collections and Share Content
</h5>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Your VMware stack spans many products and versions and you need a way to manage the product documentation for your specific portfolio. MyLibrary enables you to assemble custom doc sets and share as HTML collections. You can add and organize product documentation from any product, any version, and any language.
</p>
