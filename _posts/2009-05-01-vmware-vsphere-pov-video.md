I have finally retreived the video from my Sony HD Cam and converted it for view online!  Boy this was a long process&#8230;the video is 80 minutes long and features my POV from the launch event on April 21st.  I&#8217;m sorry that the video just cuts out, after 80 minutes of HD recording my camera just died. Be sure to check out my other candid [videos](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/04/21/vmware-vsphere-launch/) and [photos](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/04/28/photos-from-vsphere-launch/).   Enjoy the show!
