It has been confirmed that I will be speaking at SAP Virtualization Week this year, I will be discussing the City of San Diego&#8217;s implementation of SAP Netweaver 7 on VMware ESX 3.5.  Here is some information direct from the SAP Enterprise Virtualization website:

So, I will be heading up to Palo Alto on April 17th, I&#8217;m going to make a little vacation into as my _Significant Other_ has never been up to Northern California.  For those of you that cannot budget for this event, they are making available online through a Citrix GoToWebinar.  If your planning on attending on-site let me know, I&#8217;d love to meet any of my readers.

Special Thanks to <a href="http://www.NetApp.com" target="_blank">NetApp</a> for sponsoring me to attend and speak at this event.
