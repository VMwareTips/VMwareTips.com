Not to let the entire cat out of the bag, but some of you have probably already speculated this.  The next release of VMware Virtual Infrastructure (VI4) will be renamed. It will no longer be Virtual Infrastructure and the VI branding will go away.  The most I can tell you is that the new name _will be out of this world_.

## Happy Holidays to all of you.
