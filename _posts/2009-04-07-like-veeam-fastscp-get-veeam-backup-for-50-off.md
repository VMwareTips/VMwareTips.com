The past few weeks I&#8217;ve been working with a customer that only has ESXi, <a href="http://www.veeam.com/vmware-esxi-fastscp.html" target="_blank">Veeam FastSCP</a> has came in really handy lately! I can copy files between systems or between a system and my desktop, the flexibility it creates is amazing.  It also attempts to utilize the VMKernel API first, if it cannot make a connection that way it will fallback to SSH.  Did I forget to mention, its blazing fast!

Well, now is your chance to get <a href="http://www.veeam.com/go/backup-upgrade/" target="_blank">Veeam Backup and Replication</a> for 50% off! Don&#8217;t miss this great opportunity to get a solid backup utility for your ESX(i) infrastructure.  Oh yeah, it also works with ESXi Free Edition!
