I just wanted to spend some time to tell you about two great books recently released by Pearson publishing. Both are focused on VMware vSphere 4 and will help you do two things&#8230;learn more about vSphere and how to administer it, then help you to pass the VCP-410 exam which is needed for VMware Certified Professional (VCP) certification.

The first book, _<a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0137058977" target="_blank">VMware ESX and ESXi in the Enterprise</a>_ by <a href="http://twitter.com/Texiwill" target="_blank">Edward Haletky</a>is now in its second edition which includes details into the new features found in vSphere 4.1. As you may or may not know, Edward runs <a href="http://www.VirtualizationPractice.com" target="_blank">VirtualizationPractice.com</a>and has been a virtualization evangelist for quite some time. In addition to the blog site, Edward is also the moderator and host of the <a href="http://www.virtualizationpractice.com/blog/?page_id=4852" target="_blank">Virtualization Security Podcast</a>. If you&#8217;re looking to expand your vSphere knowledge I&#8217;d strongly suggest checking out this book, there is even a free chapter available for <a href="http://www.informit.com/content/images/9780137058976/samplepages/0137058977.pdf" target="_blank">download</a>.

Once you&#8217;ve read Edward&#8217;s book and have configured your own vSphere environment in your home lab, the next thing to do is prepare for the VCP-410 exam. <a href="http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0789740567" target="_blank"><em>VCP4 Exam Cram: VMware Certified Professional, 2nd Edition</em></a> has just been revised to include all of the latest updates to the VCP-410 exam. <a href="http://www.eliaskhnaser.com/blogger.aspx?id=2" target="_blank">Elias Khnaser</a> takes you through what is needed to become VCP Certified, it provides coverage and practice questions for every exam topic. The book contains an extensive set of preparation tools, such as quizzes, Exam Alerts, and a practice exam, while the CD provides real-time practice and feedback with a 75-question test engine.

There you have it, two great reads on expanding your knowledge around VMware vSphere 4. You don&#8217;t have to take my word for it, but the job market around virtualization is growing like crazy so learning as much as you can and becoming certified is the clear cut way to jumping into this great line of work!
