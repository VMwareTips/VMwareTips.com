<a style="float: right;" href="/tp/.a/6a00d8341c328153ef01543330c84d970c-pi"><br /> </a>Dell and VMware have identified compatibility concerns with the H730 and FD332 storage controllers and VMware Virtual SAN version 6.2

The following storage controllers have been identified:

  * Dell PERC H730
  * Dell PERC H730P
  * Dell PERC H730 mini
  * Dell PERC H730P mini
  * Dell FD332-PERC – Single ROC
  * Dell FD332-PERC – Dual ROC

These concerns **do not apply to versions prior to Virtual SAN 6.2. Virtual SAN 6.1 and prior versions are still fully supported with Dell PERC H730 Dell 12G controllers**.

Customers are urged to read KB article: <a href="http://vmw.re/1Lr40Vu" target="_blank">Compatibility Concerns with Virtual SAN 6.2 and Dell PERC H730 and FD332-PERC Controllers (2144614)</a>
