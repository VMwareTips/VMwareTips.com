I went ahead and had some stickers made for VMworld and I wanted to give my readers the first chance to obtain some of these wicked pieces of art! These are high quality full color stickers printed on premium 70lb label stock with a high gloss UV coating applied. They&#8217;re oval in shape and are 3.5&#8243; wide x 2&#8243; tall, they&#8217;ll fit perfectly on your laptop or anywhere else you want to stick them.

I&#8217;m not try to get rich quick with stickers, I actually did them more as a Thank You back to the Community. If you&#8217;d like some all I&#8217;m asking for is $1.50 (in the US) and $2.50 (worldwide) donation to cover the cost of materials, shipping and my time. I&#8217;ll send you out (5) of them as soon as possible! Thanks and I hope to see you at <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2012/08/03/vmworld-2012-itinerary/" target="_blank">VMworld</a>!
