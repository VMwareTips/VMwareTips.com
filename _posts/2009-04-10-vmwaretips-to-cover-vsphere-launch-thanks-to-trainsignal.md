I am proud to announce that <a href="http://www.TrainSignal.com" target="_blank">TrainSignal</a> is VMwareTips.com&#8217;s first official advertiser! They so graciously answered a blog I put out earlier this week, looking for a company to help fund a camcorder purchase so I can report the <a href="https://www.vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/04/06/two-weeks-until-the-release-that-changes-it-all/" target="_blank">vSphere La</a><a href="https://www.vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/04/06/two-weeks-until-the-release-that-changes-it-all/" target="_blank">unch</a> back to my VMwareTips.com readers.Â  Things are finalized and as you can see there is a new ad on the left toolbar. I will be purchasing the camera shortly and I hope you look forward to the great footage I&#8217;m planning on getting while at the event.

For those of you that do not know, TrainSignal&#8217;s speciality is offering video based <a href="http://www.TrainSignal.com" target="_blank">computer training</a> to busy IT Professionals.
