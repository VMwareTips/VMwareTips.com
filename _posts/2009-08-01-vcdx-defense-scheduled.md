For those of you that know, I recently heard that I passed the <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/07/29/vcdx-design-exam-beta-results/" target="_blank">VCDX Design Exam</a>, within the e-mail it details steps required to schedule your defense and how to submit the application for defense.  Well, I figured I should schedule it to ensure I can lock a spot the week of VMworld.

I was a little concerned that they wouldn&#8217;t schedule the defense until the application was approved. To my surprise, they locked in Sept 4th for my defense and it will be pending an approved application. So, I have until August 14th to submit my application and have it approved to ensure I still have my date.  If for whatever reason my application isn&#8217;t in, or it is denied &#8211; I lose my spot.

So, wish me luck again!  I&#8217;m going to start on my application probably this weekend.  It will probably take me a few hours, if not a couple days as there is a LOT of data required.
