For those of you who haven&#8217;t purchased your pass to VMworld yet do I have a surprise for you!  Being an employee of EMC combined with EMC being a great partner of VMware allows me to extend some good perks to my readers.  If you use the following link (<a href="www.vmworld.com/registration.jspa?sponsorCode=EMC" target="_blank">http://</a><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="www.vmworld.com/registration.jspa?sponsorCode=EMC" target="_blank">www.vmworld.com/registration.jspa?sponsorCode=EMC</a>) </span>to register for VMworld and enter in the promotion code **EMC\_EB\_US2010** you will save $300 from the regular admission price (reg $1,795).

VMworld 2010 is going to have some great sessions, including some awesome Ask the Experts sessions as well as the opportunity to meet a good majority of the vSpecialist team. You can even pick yourself up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Computer-Tech/dp/0470481382" target="_blank">Mastering VMware vSphere</a> and have it signed by <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a>, <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_blank">Chad Sakac</a> and myself! Or even a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/VMware-Certified-Professional-vSphere-Certification/dp/0071633685/ref=pd_sim_b_6" target="_blank">VCP-410 study guide</a> from McGraw-Hill.

I hope to see all of you there, be sure to visit the EMC booth to meet up and chat about all things virtualization.
