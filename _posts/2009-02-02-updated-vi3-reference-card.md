Many of you know that I&#8217;m taking my VCDX Enterprise Exam at 5pm tomorrow (02/03/2009), so I&#8217;ve been going over Forbes Guthrie&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vmreference.com/downloads/vmreferenceVI3card1.3for3.5U3.pdf" target="_blank">VI3 Reference Card</a> as much as I can to freshen up my knowledge.Â  If you didn&#8217;t know, he has updated it for Update 3, so I suggest you <a href="http://www.vmreference.com/downloads/vmreferenceVI3card1.3for3.5U3.pdf" target="_blank">download</a> the latest if you haven&#8217;t already.
