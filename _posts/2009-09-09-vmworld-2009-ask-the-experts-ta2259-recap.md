First of all, thank you to our excellent panel; <a href="http://yellow-bricks.com" target="_blank">Duncan Epping</a>, <a href="http://planetvm.net" target="_blank">Tom Howarth</a>, <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a> and <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_blank">Chad Sakac</a>.

The response I&#8217;ve received from our attendees has been amazing.  It quite possibly was the best session at VMworld 2009!   Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll be pushing extra hard to get this session back for 2010!  Perhaps a Super Session?

One thing that amazed me is how we basically closed VMworld,  our repeat session did not end until 6:15pm on Thursday &#8211; pretty much when the union A/V workers started unplugging equipment!

<a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2009/09/vmworld-2009-ask-the-experts-ta2259.html" target="_blank">Chad Sakac</a> so graciously posted both sessions in video format on his website, so instead of recapping the entire session (both of them) on here, go check out the videos on <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2009/09/vmworld-2009-ask-the-experts-ta2259.html" target="_blank">his website here</a>.

So thats pretty much it, I had a great time at VMworld and finishing it with the Ask the Experts panel was great!  I&#8217;d love to have the other four panelists back next year and don&#8217;t forget to look for it on the 2010 schedule!
