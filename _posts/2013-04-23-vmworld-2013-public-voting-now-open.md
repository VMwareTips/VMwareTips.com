It&#8217;s that joyous time of year again! VMworld is fast approaching and Public Voting is NOW OPEN.  This year I&#8217;ve submitted three different Ask the Expert sessions with focus on different topics, so there should be an Ask the Expert session for you! I&#8217;ve also submitted a great session on integrating two great technologies, vSphere Metro Cluster and VMware Horizon View, you should definitely vote for it if you&#8217;re planning on building a geo-clustered View environment. These sessions won&#8217;t be picked up unless you vote for them, I&#8217;d love to see you all in these sessions so please, <a title="VMworld Session Voting" href="http://www.vmworld.com/cfp.jspa" target="_blank">vote early and vote often</a> :)
