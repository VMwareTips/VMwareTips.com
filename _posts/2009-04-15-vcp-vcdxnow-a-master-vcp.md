Jon C. Hall, from VMware&#8217;s Certification department posted a comment on <a href="http://erikzandboer.wordpress.com/2009/04/07/the-vcdx-not-quite-design-exam/" target="_blank">Erik Zandboer’s blog</a> today with regards to the VCDX Design Exam.  If you haven&#8217;t read Erik&#8217;s post, I would strongly suggest it. His comments and concerns about the VCDX Design Exam are the consensus of the majority of the people included in the Design Exam Beta, including myself.

Anyways, back to Jon&#8230; In a comment that <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/04/15/vcp-vcdx-whats-next/" target="_blank">Duncan</a> saw earlier today, Jon mentioned that they (VMware) are working on a Master VCP program, which will take you above and beyond the VCP &#8211; while the VCDX is mainly for Solutions Architects&#8230;..

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>The VCDX, as cool as it is, is specifically targeted at a solution architect level. It is not for everyone. What should be for all of you is a “next” level. This “Master VCP” certification is something that we are working very hard on being able to provide soon. It would involve being a VCP, then taking the Enterprise Administration Exam, which is part multiple choice, part practical. That exam has limited scalability at this point, and we can’t roll out this certification until we resolve that issue. Of course that is only one factor, but it is the main limiting factor at this point.</em>

  <em>So for all of you wanted the next level of mastery, just stay tuned and we will have it for you soon…</em>

Lucky me&#8230;another certification I need to work on! :)
