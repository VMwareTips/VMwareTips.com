Today an ask the experts session went live on &#8220;<a href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/experts/sddpc" target="_blank">Getting the Most ROI with Data Deduplication</a>&#8220;, this was a presentation I recorded mainly focused on NetApp&#8217;s A-SIS (Data Deduplication).  Please feel free to visit the session, check out the documentation and ask questions.  The session will be live until December 19th.

For those of you attending <a href="http://info.vmware.com/content/VirtualizationForum_Home?src=undefined&ossrc=undefined" target="_blank">VMware vForum in San Diego</a> on Wednesday, I will be speaking during the NetApp Platinum Sponsor/Customer Story session.  My presentation will be on the benefits of utilizing NetApp storage for a virtualized environment.
