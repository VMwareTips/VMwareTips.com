The past couple days have been amazing! Yesterday we woke up in Ventura and drive up the California coast, seeing San Luis Obispo, Morro Bay and Hearst Castle.  We had a lovely sunset dinner in Big Sur and finished our evening checking into our hotel in Monterey Bay.  This morning we woke up, got ready and checked out of the hotel, went to lunch at a seaside Italian restaurant, Paradiso on Cannery Row, and finished by going through the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Check out <a href="http://www.twitpic.com/photos/rick_vmwaretips" target="_blank">TwitPic</a> for my photos along the ride!

Our trip then continued into Palo Alto, the a beautiful drive on CA State Route 17 through the Santa Cruz Mountains made the traffic worth it, then arrived to Hillview Avenue&#8230;.



Well, it is about midnight here and the start of SAP Virtualization Week is tomorrow morning.  Time to get a good night sleep and start my week. Only 32 hours until the launch!
