Fortunately for those of us in IT there really isn&#8217;t a shortage of job listings on the market. I&#8217;m constantly receiving email about new VMware, Cloud and Software Defined Data Center focused jobs. Because I&#8217;m extremely happy with where I am currently at in my life, I wanted to pass along these great opportunities to my readers, so as I receive job postings I will forward them as posts on the blog. To find them you&#8217;ll need to visit the Job Listings page which could be [found here](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/category/jobs/ "Job Listings"). I&#8217;ve also created a link on the header of the website.

Thanks for following my blog!
