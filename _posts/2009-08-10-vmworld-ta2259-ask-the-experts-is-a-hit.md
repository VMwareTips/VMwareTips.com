<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Back by popular demand!</span> Oh wait, the event hasn&#8217;t even happened yet!

Received final confirmation that TA2259 &#8211; Ask the Experts featuring <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/" target="_new">Duncan Epping</a>, <a href="http://www.planetvm.net/" target="_new">Tom Howarth</a>, <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/" target="_new">Scott Lowe</a>, <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/" target="_new">Chad Sakac</a> and myself will be repeated at 4:30pm on Thursday, September 3rd.  Our first session at 1:00pm on Thursday has already filled up! So don&#8217;t worry, as of right now we have roughly 200 open seats for our repeat session.
