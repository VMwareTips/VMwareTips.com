First off I need to apologize for the lack of content lately.  It goes without saying that becoming a vSpecialist for EMC has definitely filled my schedule more than my previous role. I promise to continue to do my best in providing the latest and greatest virtualization, cloud and general information technology content.

With that said, VMworld always fills my notepads with hot new ideas, strategies, products and futures. Definitely keep an eye on the site the next few days as I will be live blogging as much as possible during Keynotes, Sessions and other events.

Keep an eye on my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rick_vmwaretips" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/rick_vmwaretips" target="_blank">TwitPic</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=vmwaretips" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/vmwaretips-com" target="_blank">UStream</a>account for live streaming of information, pictures and videos!
