It&#8217;s that time of year again, and for the 5th year I&#8217;ll be hosting _Ask the Expert vBloggers_ at VMworld 2012 in San Francisco!  This is really a great session, the audience gets to ask the questions that matter to them and get them answered by experts in the industry.  If you haven&#8217;t registered already, I strongly suggest you lock in your ticket to VMworld by <a title="Register for VMworld 2012 US" href="http://vmworld.com/registration.jspa?sponsorCode=RFU1224-94510" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.
