VMware&#8217;s first ever Technical Summit was held at the Hilton Towers in San Francisco, CA from May 5-7. This event was attended by over 900 employees from the Technical Services organization. The main objective of the event was technical training for the TS employees on new products/solutions and providing a forum for networking.

This three-day event had keynotes each day followed by various breakout sessions including hands-on labs. Keynotes included presenters from VMware, Cisco and Ebay. The breakout sessions were divided into tracks focusing on the competency areas defined in the TS Subject Matter Expert program &#8211; namely Infrastructure Virtualization, Business Continuity, Virtualization Management and Desktop. Additional breakout sessions covered topics on Competition, Application solutions and solutions from the partner ecosystem.

VMware awarded the First Eight VCDX in the entire World.Â  Duncan Epping from <a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com" target="_blank">Yellow-Bricks.com</a> is lucky to be VCDX-007 (how cool!).
