For those of you that have read my prior post on <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2008/11/02/product-review-sun-virtualbox/" target="_blank">Sun VirtualBox</a>, you would already know that I think it is a viable alternative to VMware Server.  Although I do not feel it is strong enough to contend with VMware Workstation, I feel it definietely sits at the top of the free type-2 based hypervisor offerings.  The best thing about it is that it has a build for pretty much every operating system (including Mac).

In VirtualBox version 2.1.0 there have been a ton of enhancements and bug fixes.  You can view the entire list <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Enhancements:**

  * Support for hardware virtualization (VT-x and AMD-V) on Mac OS X hosts
  * Support for 64-bit guests on 32-bit host operating systems (newer 64-bit processor required)
  * Added support for Intel Nehalem virtualization enhancements
  * Experimental 3D acceleration via OpenGL
  * Experimental LsiLogic and BusLogic SCSI controllers
  * Full VMDK/VHD support including snapshots (use your VMDKs complete with snapshots)
  * New NAT engine with signi?cantly better performance, reliability and ICMP echo (ping) support
  * New Host Interface Networking implementations for Windows and Linux hosts with easier setup
