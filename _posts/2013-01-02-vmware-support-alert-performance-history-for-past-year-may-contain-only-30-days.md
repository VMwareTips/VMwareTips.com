VMware has become aware of an issue that may occur whereby only one month of performance history appears when trying to see the past year in vSphere 5.1

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Specifically, the symptoms are:

  * You see only the last 30 days of performance history in the ‘past year’ view
  * Only one month of performance history appears when trying to see the past year

We urge you to read the official KB article for more details:
