I just wanted to give a quick shout out to VMware Press, they made VMworld 2012 San Francisco a lot of fun by providing a bundle of their books for some giveaways. For those of you that don&#8217;t know, Pearson and VMware formed a publishing alliance in 2011 which makes VMware Press the official publisher of VMware books and training materials that provide guidance for the critical topics facing today&#8217;s technology professionals and students.

From the VMware Press website;

> **VMware Press** is a publishing alliance between Pearson and VMware, and is the official publisher of VMware books and training materials that provide guidance for the critical topics facing today&#8217;s technology professionals and students.
> 
> With books, certification and study guides, video training, and learning tools produced by world-class architects and IT experts, VMware Press helps IT professionals master a diverse range of topics on virtualization and cloud computing, and is the official source of reference materials for completing the VMware certification exams.
