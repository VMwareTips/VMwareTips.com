<img class="alignright" src="http://campaign.vmware.com/partners/pc/promotions/vsphere/vsphere_promos-03.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" />A big issue for companies making the upgrade to vSphere 4 Enterprise Plus from their existing VI3 Enterprise License wasn&#8217;t the low $295 price per CPU (VMware Part VS4-ENT-ENT-PL-UG-PROMO), it was the hassle of having to renew their SnS Entitlement! What if your company just renewed their 1 Year Enterprise SnS? You&#8217;d basically need to purchase another 1 Year Enterprise Plus SnS. Even though it would push out your support another year, this additional cost could be quite high for some companies, especially if you have dozens or even hundreds of hosts!

**Customers complained and VMware Listened&#8230;**

VMware will be releasing a 2 Month Enterprise Plus SnS package for customers in this exact boat.  The price will be reasonably priced at $140 per CPU for Platinum and $120 per CPU for Gold (both estimated retail). Well thank you VMware!  IMHO the best thing you could have done was just given all your Enterprise customers a free upgrade to Enterprise Plus, but I suppose this is the 2nd best thing I could ask for&#8230;.seeing that I&#8217;m upgrading about 20 licenses in the next week.

For more information on the Enterprise to Enterprise Plus upgrade promotion, please contact your local VMware Retailer!  There is also an upgrade promotion that includes the Nexus 1000V Virtual Switch (VMware Part VS4-N1K-UG-C), this is priced at $795 per CPU.
