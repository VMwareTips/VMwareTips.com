Just wanted to write a brief post apologizing to my readers for the lack of updates the past week or two.  Many of you know that I passed my VCDX Design Exam,  so that means I must submit my application for defense (by Friday!)&#8212;this has pretty much taken up 75% of the past week, leaving the other 25% to finish up my VMworld presentations (3 of them) and still maintain a full time job!

Well, the end is near&#8230; I&#8217;ve finished my VMworld presentations and my VCDX Defense Application will be completed by tomorrow evening&#8230;.that means starting fresh on Monday morning I&#8217;ll be back in action and updating the site as much as possible!

Thank you for continuing to make this site grow! If it wasn&#8217;t for my avid readers, I wouldn&#8217;t be doing this.
