It&#8217;s with great pleasure to let all of my readers k<img class="alignright" style="border: 0px; margin: 7px;" title="Wozniak" src="http://kcvmug.com/storage/post-collateral/woz.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1354310737595" alt="" width="200" height="161" />now that I&#8217;ll be speaking at the Kansas City VMware Users Group on Tuesday, December 11th. It&#8217;s with even greater pleasure to announce that I&#8217;ll be sharing the same stage as Mr. Steve &#8220;Woz&#8221; Wozniak! (I have to present right after his keynote, how in the heck will I stay composed?!)

The VMUG will take place at the Overland Park Convention Center, where Wozniak will be opening up the event with an interactive discussion with the Kansas City VMUG Leaders. Attendees will have the unique opportunity to hear from Wozniak on his experiences working with Apple and more recently, Fusion-io.

This is an all-day VMware User Group Conference, so think of it as a mini one-day VMworld event! A number of vRockstars will be in attendance and it&#8217;ll definitely be a great time.  I know a few people will be arriving in town early and there will be a Happy Hour on Monday evening. If you live in the Kansas City area, or will be in the area, this is an event you will not want to miss!
