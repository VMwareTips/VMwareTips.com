Just wanted to throw a little hint of whats to come with VI4 later this year.Â  The VI4 Client (vSphere Client) will include Federation capabilities. For those of us with multiple vCenter servers we will be able to simultaneously connect to all of them at the same time from within a single client.

Happy Sunday!
