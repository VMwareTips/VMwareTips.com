Tony Dunn over at VMware has finally published the VMworld 2008 Confessionals to the vmworld.com website. I encourage you to check all of them out, some are pretty funny.  If you can, search for me! My personal favorite was my hype in _Don&#8217;t be Shy_.  Kudos to the VMworld team for adding another fun opportunity to the event.
