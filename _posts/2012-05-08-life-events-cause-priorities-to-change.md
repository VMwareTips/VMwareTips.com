If you haven&#8217;t noticed I&#8217;ve been lacking in the content department for VMwareTips.com and for that, I apologize. Most of my readers and friends in the industry know that when I joined EMC I&#8217;ve had some fundamental issues with content due to my new job. Frankly it was way easier to talk as a customer and end-user with tips, tricks and issues that I found when using the products on a daily basis. As an employee I&#8217;m doing a lot more evangelizing than hands-on, and the time I do spend in the lab is doing very specific projects with lab equipment..which means I either cannot discuss what&#8217;s happening or there just isn&#8217;t enough data to talk about. I did find a little niche where I was creating instructional videos on specific topics, my readers seem to like this and I really enjoy putting them together.

So why haven&#8217;t I put something together in the past couple months?  Well, some of you may know this but to the others that do not, I&#8217;ll be getting married on May 19th! This has been in the works for quite some time now, but for those of you that are married you know the last months/weeks are when the bride and groom are running around with their heads cut off doing those last minute things.

With that I thank you all for continuing to be avid readers, followers and more importantly friends in the industry. As soon as the wedding fiasco is over and we return from our tropical honeymoon I&#8217;ll be right back in the office thinking of content for the blog and awesome new things to talk about. There are some amazing new things with VMware View and vFabric that I&#8217;d love to write posts about!

On another note, we have some big events coming up including <a title="EMC World" href="http://emcworld.com/" target="_blank">EMC World</a> and <a title="VMworld" href="http://vmworld.com" target="_blank">VMworld</a>. I unfortunately will not be at EMC World but I highly recommend you attend, we&#8217;ll be showing off some mind blowing technologies (like some of the stuff Chad showed on the latest <a title="Chad's World" href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2012/04/the-most-kick-butt-hardware-episode-evah.html" target="_blank">Chad&#8217;s World</a> episode).  For VMworld I&#8217;ll be submitting four (4) different sessions, including the always popular Ask the Expert vBloggers, hopefully it will be picked up for US as well as EMEA (first time submitting for Europe!).  The Ask the Experts session is by far one of the most popular sessions at VMworld, you&#8217;ll be able to ask your questions to four of the top virtualization experts, <a title="Yellow Bricks" href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/" target="_blank">Duncan Epping</a>, <a title="Frank Denneman" href="http://frankdenneman.nl/" target="_blank">Frank Denneman</a>, <a title="Scott Lowe" href="blog.scottlowe.org" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a> and <a title="Virtual Geek" href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com" target="_blank">Chad Sakac</a>, with me moderating the madness! That&#8217;s right, four VCDXs on a single stage..it&#8217;s a great time!

That&#8217;s about it for me, I&#8217;ll most likely be off the radar until my return the week of June 11th, which actually is the week of Cisco Live 2012 in San Diego,  I&#8217;ll be speaking at a couple sessions there and if you&#8217;re planning on attending I&#8217;d love to meet at the EMC booth to chat about what you&#8217;re doing with VMware, Cisco and EMC technologies.

Look for some random tweets, perhaps some wedding photos and random chat via my <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/rick_vmwaretips" target="_blank">Twitter</a> page. Cheers!
