Most of you should already know that I will be covering the VMware vSphere Launch at the VMware HQ on Tuesday, April 21st. We&#8217;ll my girlfriend Mandy and I are on our way up the coast to Palo Alto, CA. We left San Diego last night and arrived at our first stop, Ventura Beach, CA.  We&#8217;re all rested up and heading north to our second stop along our route, Monterey Bay, CA. We&#8217;re going to stop and meet one of the editors from the <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/03/05/working-on-a-book-with-scott-lowe/" target="_blank">publishing company</a> for coffee along the way, also stop and check out <a href="http://www.hearstcastle.org" target="_blank">Hearst Castle</a>.
