That time of the year has come around again&#8230;. Eric Siebert over at <a href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/voting-now-open-for-the-top-25-vmware-virtualization-blogs.html" target="_blank">vSphere-Land</a> has opened voting for his Top 25 list, this is a great list of the best virtualization blogs out there and it&#8217;s powered by you! I&#8217;d strongly suggest going and checking out the questionnaire and telling Eric what your favorite blogs are.

You can even win some very cool prizes, so go check out vSphere-Land and <a href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/voting-now-open-for-the-top-25-vmware-virtualization-blogs.html" target="_blank">vote today</a>!
