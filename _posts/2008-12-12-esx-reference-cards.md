A customer asked if I had a reference card with common ESX commands (RCLI, etc) so I sent him three cards, which I&#8217;m posting here now for you.

First is the [vmreference VI3 card](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/vmreferencevi3card121.pdf) by Forbes Guthrie over at <a href="http://www.vmreference.com" target="_blank">www.vmreference.com</a>

Second and third are [VI3 Command References](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/edu-vi3dsa-ja2-vi3commandref.pdf) and [Linux Command References](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/edu-vi3dsa-ja1-linuxcommandref.pdf) from the VMware Deploy, Secure & Analyze class.

Enjoy!
