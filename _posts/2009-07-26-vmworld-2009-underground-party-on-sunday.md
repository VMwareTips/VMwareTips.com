If you&#8217;re flying into San Francisco on Sunday like many of us are, then be sure to attend the _Official_ VMworld 2009 Sunday Night Extravaganza.  This will be the third year that <a href="http://party.vmunderground.com/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Theron</a> and crew will be putting on this event and it sure sounds like a good time!

On Sunday, August 30th 2009 from 7-10PM, join this underground VMworld kickoff party and meet up with virtualization bloggers, vExperts, authors, Twitter users, and virtualization enthusiasts (translated v12n geeks).  My flight doesn&#8217;t come into SFO until 8:30pm so I will be a little late, however I do plan on buying some drinks for a select few&#8230;.hopefully they&#8217;re still there!

Check out the <a href="http://party.vmunderground.com/vmworld-2009-sunday-night-extravaganza/" target="_blank">official site for more details</a> and where to <a href="http://party.vmunderground.com/rsvp/" target="_blank">RSVP</a> for this event.
