I&#8217;ll be in the Phoenix area the third week of September for a lunch and learn event all around End User Computing (VDI). Come join me for some good grub, an informative and educational discussion and then for some fun on the race track afterwards!

Technology is changing faster than ever for todayâ€™s mobile workforce. Can your end user computing environment provision new technologies rapidly and meet ever-escalating performance requirements? Are you able to give users access to key applications across all leading platforms and devices?

EMC and VMware solutions help transform end user computing with new efficiency and flexibility. All while providing simple management, centralized control, and maximum protection.

EMC and VMware joint solutions deliver end user freedom and IT control. Simplify desktop management with VMware View. Enable new efficiency and agility with EMC VNX unified storage and Avamar deduplication backup software and system. Plus, expertise from EMC Global Services helps you plan, deploy, manage, and protect your end user computing environment.

**Our end-to-end solutions enable you to:**

  * Raise Performance. Boot 1,000 desktops in 8 minutes, and speed backups by 10x
  * Raise Efficiency. Scale to thousands of users without disruption, and reduce backup storage by 10-30x
  * Choose a Proven Solution. Turn to EMC for powerful solutions validated for VMware

**Join us for some indoor go-kart racing after lunch.**
