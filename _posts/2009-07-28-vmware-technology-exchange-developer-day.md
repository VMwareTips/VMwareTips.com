**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expanded Technical Focus</span>**

As a &#8220;Developer Day&#8221;, the primary focus of this event is on helping developers integrate with VMware platforms. We will cover developer technologies related to all three of VMware&#8217;s product areas – datacenter, desktop and cloud – in sessions and corresponding demos. A sample of topics to be covered include vSphere Web Services SDK, APIs for managing and automating guest OS, vCloud API introduction, vApps, vStorage, productivity tools and much more. Packaged into beginner and advanced level sessions, the content will be tailored specifically to help developers learn about VMware&#8217;s integration APIs, understand implementation best practices and see examples. Corresponding demos will provide further opportunity for training and discussion with VMware engineers in small-group settings.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meet VMware Engineers and Get Free Software</span>**

In addition to great content, there will be ample opportunity to network with VMware engineers, product managers, alliances managers and other key personnel. What is more, all attendees will get a complementary 1-year developer license to vSphere Standard product.
