VMware has become aware of an issue caused by expired passwords in the virtual machines that make up the Horizon Workspace vApp. The issue affects VMware Horizon Workspace 1.5.0 (Build Number 1220937)

VMware Support has issued two new KB articles. One applies to those currently installing VMware Horizon Workspace, the other to those already using the product. We recommend you familiarize yourself with both articles.
