Today I needed a little amusement.  In an article posted on <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/storage-soup/netapp-previews-new-gui/" target="_blank">Tech Target</a>, Beth Pariseau discusses the new upcoming NetApp System Manager (NSM). In a comment from Reinoud Reynders, IT manager for the University of Hospitals of Leuven in Belgiumin, he states:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>&#8220;In general, a GUI is a sexy tool, that all vendors like to demonstrate but a “real/old fashioned” system engineer will use it not very often. For vendors, it’s very important that they have one (for pre-sales activities), but after that, the use is less important.&#8221;</em>
</p>

Being a UNIX Administrator at heart, this made me chuckle.  But then I started thinking about ESXi and how you need the VIC (vSphere Client) to maintain and manage&#8230;.I almost started crying, I&#8217;ll be forced to use a GUI to manage my own systems&#8230;but then I remembered, ESXi has a <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2008/10/20/access-the-esxi-service-console/" target="_blank">hidden console</a>!  Whew!

Check out the <a href="http://blogs.netapp.com/exposed/2009/02/fas2050-wins-aw.html" target="_blank">award NetApp won at VMworld Europe</a>.  This post also includes screen shots from the upcoming NetApp System Manager.
