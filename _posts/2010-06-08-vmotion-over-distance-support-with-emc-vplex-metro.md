Last month at EMC World we released a storage virtualization product unlike any other. EMC VPLEX not only virtualizes back-end storage from other vendors it also allows shared storage to be presented active/active over long distances. This capability makes it possible for long distance vMotion and brings a new technical term to disaster planning, Disaster Avoidance.

Imagine you&#8217;re planning a datacenter shutdown due to a power outage or building maintenance, or perhaps that wildfire is making its way to your office location. Now you have the flexibility to be able to avoid major downtime by simply swinging your workloads to an off-site datacenter.

VMware has taken notice and has officially released a KB article detailing out full support for long distance vMotion with the EMC VPLEX product. More information on this KB article can be found at <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1021215" target="_blank">http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1021215</a>. Perhaps you want to know more about VPLEX or even see a demo of it in action?Â Chad Sakac posted a great breakdown of how it works along with some videos on his website, <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2010/05/your-virtual-machine-teleporter-is-ready-are-you.html" target="_blank">check it out now</a>.
