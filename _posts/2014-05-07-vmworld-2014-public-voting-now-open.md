Boy, time really seems to be going by faster the older I get. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already been a year and we now preparing for VMworld 2014. This year I&#8217;ve submitted three separate Ask the Experts session and it&#8217;s up to you to get them included in the session agenda of VMworld 2014.  As you know, these are some of the highest rated, most attended and funnest sessions of VMworld. 7 years strong, let&#8217;s have some fun and get your questions answered by a panel of amazing experts.

For those of you that haven&#8217;t attended one of my Ask the Experts sessions here&#8217;s what you can expect&#8230; A packed audience, a panel of some of the best industry experts out there and a forum for you to ask the questions you need answers to. These industry titans have lived, breathed and defeated some of the most complex designs and problems. vSphere? vCloud Automation Center? vCenter Operations? Horizon View? Bring it on!
