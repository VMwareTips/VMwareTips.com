I&#8217;ll be giving a customer example presentation at the San Diego Go Green event which is put on by NetApp and VMware.  If your new to virtualization, or would like to learn more about NetApp, I strongly suggest you sign-up and attend one of these briefings.  You will also get a nice free lunch!   The San Diego event is at Morton&#8217;s Steakhouse, so the food will definitely be good!

After events end I will plan on publishing my presentation on here.  Please check all of my other conference notices because I will be uploading those presentations shortly.
