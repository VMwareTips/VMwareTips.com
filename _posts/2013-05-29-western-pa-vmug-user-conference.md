It&#8217;s with great honor that I accepted a request to speak at the Western PA VMUG User Conference, tomorrow in the Moon Township suburb of Pittsburgh. I&#8217;m not only speaking at an EMC focused session, but also an Ask the Experts panel discussion with some other great Virtualization Heavyweights such as Chris Colotti, Alan Renouf, Mike Laverick and Scott Lowe.
