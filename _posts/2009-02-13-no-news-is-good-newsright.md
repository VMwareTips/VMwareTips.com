Well, its been 10 days since I&#8217;ve taken the <a href="http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/02/04/vcdx-enterprise-administration-exam-complete/" target="_blank">VCDX Enterprise Admin Exam</a>, and I still haven&#8217;t heard from the VMware Certification department on the results.  Perhaps this is a good thing?  Does the old saying _&#8220;No News is Good News&#8221;_ apply in this situation?  Anyways, I&#8217;m stressing myself out thinking about it, it also doesn&#8217;t help knowing that a couple of the lab answers I did were wrong.  Thinking back now I&#8217;m almost certain I forgot to do two things that were parts of the questions, things that are no-brainer do them all the time type things&#8230;but in a testing environment it is easy to choke under the gun!

Oh well, hopefully I&#8217;ll hear something on Tuesday!  You guys have a great weekend, and be sure to do something nice for your loved one tomorrow (Valentine&#8217;s Day).
