VMware has become aware of situation whereby hard disks and/or nics may be removed from a virtual machine when reconfiguring VM workflows in vRealize Automation.

We have identified two distinct scenarios where this might happen and so have create two separate KB articles. Please familiarize yourself with both articles so that you can avoid these situations.

  1. <a href="http://vmw.re/1CppMEA" target="_blank">When performing reconfigure operations in multiple browser tabs In VMware vRealize Automation, the hard disks and NICs are removed unexpectedly (2124198)</a>
  2. <a href="http://vmw.re/1MeYGQg" target="_blank">In VMware vRealize Automation, the hard disks are removed unexpectedly when reconfiguring a virtual machine that has RDM disks (2124657)</a>

Any updates to this information will be made in the KB articles themselves. The Additional Information section details how to receive these updates.
