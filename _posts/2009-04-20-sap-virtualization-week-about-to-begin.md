Even though I will not be actively blogging about <a href="https://cw.sdn.sap.com/community/esc/cag11" target="_blank">SAP Virtualization Week</a>, I did want to share one post with a welcome video. Those those of you that did not know, SAP Virtualization Week is conveniently occurring the same week as the VMware vSphere launch.  I will be speaking at the SAP conference on Wednesday but wanted to check out a couple of the sessions on Monday and Tuesday.  This is not a traditional conference (like VMworld), this is all happening within a single room at the SAP Co-Innovation Lab in Palo Alto, it looks like there is room for about 125-150 visitors and each session will be occurring consecutively.

<a href="https://cw.sdn.sap.com/community/esc/cag11/sapvweek2009session24" target="_blank">My session</a> will be on Wednesday at 4:00pm PST, my topic will be on how The City of San Diego is utilizing virutalization for their SAP deployment.

Like I said, I will not be actively blogging, but be sure to check <a href="http://twitter.com/rick_vmwaretips" target="_blank">my Twitter updates</a> as I post pictures and comments about SAP Virtualization Week 2009. #SAPVW
