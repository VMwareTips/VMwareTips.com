I&#8217;ve known for a few months that I passed the DCA exam because of e-mails that VMware Certification sent out, but what I did not know was my actual certification number.

Participants of the VCP, VCAP and VCDX certification tracks are assigned certification numbers when they successfully pass the required exams for that track. For example, I&#8217;m VCP #7315 which I received when I passed the VCP2 exam and I&#8217;m VCDX #21 which I received when completing all necessary steps for VCDX certification.

So I received in the mail the typical &#8220;Welcome Kit&#8221; that you receive with your certificate. In this kit I received the _Congratulations_ letter, my free copy of Workstation, a nice <a href="http://twitpic.com/3x7k6q" target="_blank">vCAP hat</a> and the actual certificate. To my surprise my number is VCAPDCA-1 which means I was the first person to take and successfully pass the DCA exam. Quite exciting!

I&#8217;m a fairly humble person, as most people would say about me, but I am pretty stoked about being #1 and by no means would I consider myself in the same category as <a href="http://twitter.com/vcdx001" target="_blank">VCDX #1</a>. Thank you VMware for allowing me to be part of such as great certification beta program! I can&#8217;t wait to see what other great programs you come out with.
