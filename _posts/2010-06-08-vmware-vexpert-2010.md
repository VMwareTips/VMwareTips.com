Thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/jtroyer" target="_blank">John Troyer</a>for building such a great community and for creating such a program that shows how much VMware truly respects the effort we put into evangelizing virtualization to the public.

For those of you that do not know, the VMware vExpert program was created in 2009 to show appreciation for those individuals who have significantly contributed to the community of VMware users over the past year. For more information on the program visit <a href="http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/" target="_blank">http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/</a>.

On Twitter @maishsk has put together a list of vExpert 2010 recipients, you can find that list <a href="http://twitter.com/maishsk/vmware-vexpert-2010" target="_blank">here</a>.
