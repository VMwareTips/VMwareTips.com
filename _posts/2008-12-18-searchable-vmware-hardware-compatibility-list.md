Just like most of you, I was sick of having to download the VMware HCL lists in PDF format from the VMware website, then search through them for my system or device.   VMware has now made it extremely quick and easy, all of the HCLs are now completely search-able. You can search by manufacturer, model or even keyword. Results are exportable to PDF or CSV format.

Check it out for yourself, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/hcl" target="_blank">http://www.vmware.com/go/hcl<br /> </a>*New search system is for ESX 3.0.x and above, for prior versions please revert to PDF files.
