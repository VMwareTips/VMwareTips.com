This morning I called Tina in the VMware Certification department, it has been 17 days and I still haven&#8217;t heard of my VCDX Enterprise Administration Exam results.  Well, Tina looked up my record and said she has yet to hear from the &#8220;Exam Admins&#8221;, and that should would get back to me.

A few hours later, I receive an e-mail from VCDX@vmware.com and within second a phone call from Tina&#8230;

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>Congratulations on passing this exam. Passing this exam is the second of the four parts required to achieve the VMware Certified Design Expert designation. The next component is the VMware Design Exam. You will be sent registration information and voucher for admission to this exam when it publicly released in late February 2009. Please contact VMware if there are any changes to your mailing address as provided to VMware at the time of registration. Please be sure to watch for important announcements at the VMware VCDX program on the website: http://www.vmware.com/certification</em>
</p>

Hooray!  What a great start to the weekend!  Tina informed me that she should be in contact sometime within the next couple weeks to schedule the Design Exam.   Only two more rounds of stress and anxiety to go!
