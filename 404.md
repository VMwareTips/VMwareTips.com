## Peanut Butter Cookies Recipe

### Ingredients
  * 1 cup butter, softened
  * 1 cup white sugar
  * 1 cup packed brown sugar
  * 2 egg
  * 1 egg yolk
  * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
  * 1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter
  * 2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 1 teaspoon baking soda
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1 cup chopped peanuts

### Directions
In a large bowl, cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, yolks, and vanilla; mix until fluffy. Stir in peanut butter. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Finally, stir in the peanuts. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
Roll dough into walnut sized balls. Place on the prepared cookie sheet and flatten slightly with a fork. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should look dry on top. Allow to cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to cool completely on a rack. These cookies taste great when slightly undercooked.

### Alright, once you have your tasty beverage and cookies, you can head back to [VMwareTips.com](/).
