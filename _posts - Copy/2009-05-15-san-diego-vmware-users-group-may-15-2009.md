I was asked to speak at the San Diego VMUG meeting this morning, the event had a really good turn out with close to 200 VMware fans!  My session had two major parts, first I discussed vSphere and all the new enchancements, features and names (oh the names) :)   I then talked a little on best practices for deploying mission/business critical applications on VMware, mostly covering on how a solid design is the most important piece of a Virtual Infrastructure, then on how you need to understand how CPU Co-Scheduling and Memory Sharing works &#8211; along with some examples on how to look for contention issues.

I&#8217;ve included my presentation for everyone to enjoy, I also suggest checking out the San Diego VMUG page on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=853637&trk=hb_side_g" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> if you are in the Southern California area.  The PowerPoint version of this presentation can also be downloaded [HERE](http://www.vmwaretips.com/presentations/SD_VMUG-May 2009.ppsx).
