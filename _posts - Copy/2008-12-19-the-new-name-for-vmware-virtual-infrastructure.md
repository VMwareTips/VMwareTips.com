Well, yesterday I posted an article about a new name for VI4 &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure if I sparked something somewhere but the cats out of the bag&#8230;.being under NDA I&#8217;ve known this new name for a few weeks now but couldn&#8217;t announce.  **VMware VI4 will now be _VMware vSphere_** 

Not a bad idea with all the other re-branding they&#8217;re doing, but personally I think they could&#8217;ve come up with something better.   Regardless, the product speaks for itself, who cares what the name is. :)
