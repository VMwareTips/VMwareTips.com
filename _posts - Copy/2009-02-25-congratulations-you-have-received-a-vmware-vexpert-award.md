A special thank you to all of you that made this award possible! I&#8217;d like to especially thank God, my parents and all my loyal fans! :)   Well, this morning like many others I was excited to see an email from John Troyer announcing my award as a VMware vExpert!  I can&#8217;t wait to see what the gift is!

Thanks again John and everyone at VMware for doing this.  It really makes us feel good, being recognized for the hard work we put into loving VMware and it&#8217;s products. :)
