It makes me very proud to announce that I received my VCAP4-DCD Beta Exam results and much to my surprise (honestly) **I passed!**

> Congratulations on passing the VMware Certified Advanced Professional on vSphere4 â€“ Datacenter Design exam! You will receive an email notification from certification@vmware.com once your certification status has been confirmed and added to your VMware Education Transcript (allow 10 days).

Based on the following VMware Education diagram, currently holding the VCDX3 certification and passing the VCAP4-DCD exam upgrades you to the VCDX4 certification.

  Thank you VMware for allowing me to be part of such a great education program. Now it&#8217;s time to celebrate a little!
